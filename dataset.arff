'New Delhi:?In a tragic incident, a DSP with Jammu & Kashmir police,?Mohammed Ayub Pandith, was beaten to death?late last night in the Nowhatta area of Srinagar. Ayub Pandith was deployed for the security of separatist leader Mirwaiz Farooq. After the initial shock and outrage, news channels are now wondering how to cover this particular incident of mob lynching.Explaining the dilemma several media outlets are facing, a senior editor said ,?Well, obviously we can?t ignore this public lynching but at the same time, we can?t cover any lynching if we can?t link it to cows and beef. We are sitting on the horns of dilemma here and initial reports aren?t too encouraging, nobody saw a cow in the vicinity. Therefore, I have asked our ace investigative reporter to go to Srinagar immediately and check for cows within a 10 Kilometer radius of the incident.?When we asked how they will link random cows to the lynching, he said ,?Are you doubting our ability? When we can link Jharkhand lynchings to cows then what is the big deal in Srinagar? We just need to be sure that there were cows in the area. Fact-check is a very important part of journalism today, especially in this post-truth world.?Meanwhile, when Faking News approached the government for their reaction to this barbaric incident, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said ,?Our priority is to provide security to the separatist leaders. As long as they are safe, the situation is under control.?After this statement, several policemen of J&K police declared support for separatists to ensure their safety.',fake
'If you ever wondered how far Comey and his FBI can dive into the Huma Abedin, Clinton e-mails let me inform you. ?It?s policy and procedure for the Justice Dept. to give the FBI a ?warrant to allow them to ?investigate a hi-government official employee such as Abedin for ?exposing any national security information. They will examine whether or not material contained in Huma Abudim computer was classified. ?Basically, it?s what ?the Bureau did in its previous email investigation ?about Hillary Clintons e-mail server.The FBI agency had already possessed Weiner?s laptop, but agents were required to obtain a separate warrant to investigate the content of Abedin?s emails. The original warrant obtained for Weiner?s laptop only allowed for examination of content related to his alleged messages with a teenage girl. For the record, Weiner has firmly denied exchanging any inappropriate messages with minors.Now, agents will begin going through the Abedin?s 650,000 or more emails that were discovered on four computers. ?She was to have turned these over way back when and she didn?t.However, the FBI only has probable cause to search the emails relevant to the Clinton investigation, so the actual number of emails whose content will be searched is going to be a lower number. Agents may find new information but it?s possible that any emails sent to and from Clinton?s private server have already been seen by the FBI during its previous email investigation.With both warrants allowing the search, Comey wishes they could find pertinent info before Election Day, but federal law enforcement officials anonymously stated that there was ?no chance the email review could be completed before Election Day,? due to the highly compressed time period.Senate Democrats want this info out NOW. ?They are fueled by frustration and anger over Comey?s decision to re-open the case. It will probably affect the Election.

'BREAKING: Capitol Hill Shooter Identified as Right Wing Extremist\nKip LeSale\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/breaking-capitol-hill-shooter-identified-as-right-wing-extremist/\nWASHINGTON DC – On Monday afternoon, an extremist carried out an attack on Capitol Hill, shooting and injuring a police officer. The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.\nWhen the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitor’s center, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.\n“All I heard was ‘[expletive removed] Obama! [expletive removed] liberals and ISIS! Make America great again!” John Burke, a college student visiting the visitors center stated to ABC News. “Then we heard gun shots and were immediately instructed to leave the building.”Thomas Finnigan is a 32 year old white supremacist linked towards having a strong affinity for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump on his Facebook. He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.\n“It’s concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest,” ABC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. “While in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.”UPDATE 4:00 PM EST: The lockdown has been lifted according to Capitol Police.\nUPDATE 4:37 PM EST: According to Capitol Police, no officer was shot.

'Christian Anti-Masturbation Mascot Arrested For Public Masturbation At Japanese Embassy\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/anti-masturbation-mascot-arrested-public-masturbation/\nLos Angeles, CA — In an ironic twist of a fate, a mascot for a Christian anti-masturbation organization was arrested today for masturbating in public while at a protest being held at the Japanese Embassy in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 37-year-old Paul Horner, was arrested at the Japanese Consulate after protesters notified police about a man running through their protest with nothing on except a dolphin mascot head while touching himself. Ironically the protest was over Japan’s annual dolphin drive held in the town of Taiji that kills thousands of dolphins a year. During Horner’s arrest, it was learned he was out on work release from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, where he is currently serving eight-years for his 4th arrest of public masturbation along with a charge of aggravated assault on a police officer.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she was at the protest when police arrived.\n\n“It was really weird to see a naked man fondling himself and wearing a dolphin’s mascot head while running through a group of dolphin protesters,” Bradley said. “I thought maybe it was a stunt the protesters were doing to get more attention but I guess not.”\n\nTom Downey with the Los Angeles Police Department, who took Horner into custody, spoke with local news station KABC about the arrest.\n\n“At first we thought he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about children and how deadly it is for them to masturbate. Telling us he was at the park with a Christian organization speaking to children about the dangers of masturbation. Saying things like, ‘They need to stop playing on the Devil’s playground, stop pounding their Devil stick and ringing the Devil’s doorbell’, we thought he was insane,” Downey said. “Turns out he actually was with this anti-masturbation organization who were accompanying a group of 3rd graders around the park when Horner left the children when he saw images of dolphins on the signs that these protesters were carrying. Mr. Horner said he was ‘aroused’ by all the pictures of dolphins. We further learned that Mr. Horner has four previous arrests for public masturbation, all while employed by this anti-masturbation organization.”\n\n\n\nHorner, along with his organization, Stop Masturbation Now, recently finished a federally funded 31-city nationwide school tour which they claim focused on educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.\n\nLonnie Childs who is president and founder of Stop Masturbation Now spoke with reporters about the future of the organization after this recent setback.\n\n“Thanks to your tax dollars, Fappy has helped tens of thousands of children learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During his countless visits to schools around the world, Fappy has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; he has done amazing things,” Childs said. “It is a shame how the media is portraying Fappy right now. Paul Horner is a great man. He is passionate about his work, he loves being Fappy and he especially loves the kids. They even have a nickname for him; they call him the tickle monster. But now, all of that is possibly ruined by some trumped-up charges by the Los Angeles five-oh, such a shame.” Childs continued, “These lies about Fappy sicken me to my very core. The employees who supposedly observed the incident in question need to be investigated. What is their motive? Are they masturbators? Are they agents of Big Masturbation? What are their crimes? These are the questions that must be addressed. Furthermore, we have found that, over the years, the only thing that Fappy “beats” are all the fraudulent charges brought against him. I have activated my prayer app and I ask that each and every one of you to keep Fappy in your prayers until this misunderstanding is resolved.”\n\n40-year-old Phil Freedom, who was there protesting at the Japanese Embassy, witnessed the act in question.\n\n“This man just started running around, naked, furiously masturbating and yelling something about how great Donald Trump was. He then put on this dolphin mascot head and attempted to hump one of our protest signs that had an image of a dolphin on it. It was absolutely horrifying.”\n\nOn the group’s Facebook page, news was posted of the arrest.\n\n“All my faithful Fappy followers, I have some extremely bad news to report. I want you to hear it here first before the liberal media hate machine and Big Masturbation spread their lies about this incident. Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, an inmate at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility, was out on work release in Los Angeles, California this morning. Fappy, as usual, was educating elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. Somehow he got separated from the group and joined up with a dolphin protest at the Japanese Embassy there. It is “reported” by “police” that he took off his mascot costume and began running around naked while touching himself. Our lawyers tell us he is being charged with public masturbation, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. He is currently being held at the Los Angeles Central Jail until a bond is set by a judge, this happening hopefully soon. These are obviously lies, but until we have all the information, please don’t jump to any conclusions. Please keep Fappy in your prayers during this difficult time. Praise Fappy!”\n\nHorner’s attorney, Katie Glacier, told ABC News that the dolphin mascot is innocent of these crimes but will continue teaching masturbation prevention while in prison.\n\n“Horner is in good spirits and patiently waiting to see a judge for his bond hearing,” Smith said. “Horner told me he is innocent, but if found guilty, says he will put an end to inmate masturbation in every jail and prison across the country, starting with the one he is currently serving time at. I personally was not aware of this information about the penal system, but it seems jail is just a hotbed for self-rape and immoral acts. Horner is a saint, a hero, a prophet, and a savior to all the lost heathenish souls out there with deadly masturbation addictions.” Glacier continued, “This may be his fifth arrest for masturbating in public, and may be currently serving an eight-year prison term for the same crimes, but that doesn’t mean he’s guilty this time. If Donald Trump was President, this wouldn’t have happened, or if it did, Fappy would be immediately pardoned. I guess at this time, all I can ask is that you please keep Fappy in your prayers during these difficult times.”\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

'New Delhi. Thousands of robots from Russia retweeted #RahulBOTAttack, it was learnt by the IT team of OfficeOfRG, amidst the uproar in the TV debates on the same topic.

The accusation came from the media and BJP amidst Rahul?s tweet supporting a Tamil movie and attacking BJP and the PM in particular.?When we were tasked with increasing the popularity of OfficeOfRG in social media, we believed in technology. After all, we are the technology wing of the party. It is a lot easier to program and train robots compared to that of people with Twitter accounts. A lot of them do not re-tweet. Even a few who re-tweet, always add a disclaimer saying that the RTs are not endorsements. The BOTs would not only re-tweet but also endorse every tweet? the IT wing head told Faking News.?The problem with the Twitter account holders is that they think they are the intellectual community of the social media. Following someone like OfficeOfRG is not a fascinating proposition for many such users. Some in BJP always brag that their leader is an unquestionable leader. In the current political conditions in our country, only OfficeOfRG is the unquestionable leader. The BOTs never question, you know? she further added.?Of course we used the BOTs.

'Donald Trump: “I Will Pay The Legal Fees Of My Followers Who Attack Protesters”\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/donald-trump-will-pay-the-legal-fees-followers-who-attack-protesters/\nDonald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but today he just went to a whole new level when he announced on Fox News that he will pay any legal fees occurred by his supporters who get into altercations with protesters.\n\n“I know there has been talk of me paying the legal fees of those accused of assaulting protesters at my events and after thinking long and hard about this matter, I’ve decided I want to go ahead and do that,” Trump said. “My followers are passionate about making this country great again and I need to support them in any way that I can. If my followers are arrested, just for being patriotic, loyal, God-fearing Americans, then I will pay their legal fees,” Trump continued. “I know it could get costly, but it’s time to take a stand against those who cannot conform to a basic set of rules, a system. And these protesters, who still live at home with their mommy and daddy, they hate America, and they hate freedom and they deserve what they get.”\n\nToday is the first time Trump has made it official that he will indeed pay the legal fees incurred by his followers in the event of an arrest, but not the first time he has talked about the subject. In February, Trump told a crowd to ‘knock the crap out’ of protesters and that ‘I will pay for the legal fees’. Then just days after canceling a rally in Chicago due to violence, Trump said he might pay the legal fees of John McGraw, 78, who sucker-punched a protester at a rally in North Carolina.\n\n“There used to be consequences’ for protesting,” Trump said. “I’m not condoning violence, but what ever happened to the days when police were allowed to just do their job? I remember the Kent State shootings. Were police out of line doing what they did there? How can I be the one to say what’s right and what’s wrong? I’d have to do more research on that. Honestly, I’d have to look into it, it would be unfair otherwise.”\n\nBesides the many protesters at his rallies, Trump also has them online. On March 4th the group Anonymous posted a video declaring “total war” on the presidential candidate. It hopes to not only bring down many of Trump’s sites, but also halt his presidential bid by uncovering and exposing embarrassing information.\n\n“We need you to shut down his campaign and sabotage his brand,” said a Guy Fawkes-masked individual in the video. “Your inconsistent and hateful campaign has not only shocked the United States of America, you have shocked the entire planet with your appalling actions and ideas.”\n\nUsing the hashtag, #OpTrump, the group is asking for help on April 1st to bring down websites that belong to Trump such as, donaldjtrump.com, trump.com, trumpchicago.com, trumphotelcollection.com, donaldtrump2016online.com and citizensfortrump.com.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she disapproves of the Trump campaign.\n\n“Donald Trump is bringing out the worst in the worst people. It is only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or killed at one of his rallies,” Bradley said. “Trump has made no attempt to correct his followers on their racist remarks, their bigotry or stop any of their violent outbursts, not once. If their was a Hitler playbook, it would be in Trump’s back pocket.”\n\nTrump finished by saying that he will do what it takes to stop the violence at his rallies.\n\n“These protesters think they can flip the bird and shout out whatever they want, and I’m here to say, we won’t put up with it anymore,” Trump said. “Remember the civil rights protesters in Selma who attacked police back in the 60’s? The police held their ground on something they believed was right, something that would keep America great. And honestly I don’t know exactly what happened there, I’d have to look into it. You wouldn’t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. But what happened to those days?”\n\nWashington political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News that the problem with the violence generated by Trump’s supporters starts with Trump himself.\n\n“This hate and ignorance has always been there, Donald Trump just gave it a place to gather and unite,” Horner said. “With four bankruptcies, three wives, despises minorities and the gay community, believes every religion is wrong except his own; Donald Trump is the perfect Republican candidate for President.”\n\nTrump’s campaign has set up a hotline for any of his followers who incur legal charges in the event of an arrest at (785) 273-0325.',fake
'The United States Revokes Scientology’s Tax-Exempt Status\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/united-states-revokes-scientologys-tax-exempt-status/\nIn a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court today, the eight justices ruled in favor of revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States. Under the ruling, Scientology will still be able to operate as a business but no longer as a non-profit religious organization.\n\nThe case was brought forward by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division after concluding a two-year-long investigation into the inner workings of Scientology. The investigation, along with an extensive audit, found the group to be a “criminal operation with a sole purpose of making money”. The eight justices agreed with the IRS and its findings that Scientology was neither a religion or fell under the guidelines of a non-profit charitable organization.\n\nCI Special Agent, Tom Downey, worked closely with IRS Chief Counsel Criminal Tax Attorneys during the course of the investigation.\n\n“If private schools had similar prices to the courses in Scientology, students would receive the absolute highest level of education by the top educators in the country,” Downey said. “But in reality, based on the ridiculously high cost of Scientology, there is no school out there that even exists. The best schools in this country charge a fraction of the exorbitant amounts of money that Scientology charges its members.”\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesperson for Scientology, told ABC News the ruling is “discrimination based on religious beliefs”.\n\n“In a free country, such as ours, it amazes me that over ten million Scientologists can have their beliefs trampled on like this,” Horner said. “The Church of Scientology is working hard to make this world a better place, constructing more buildings and ships and other really neat stuff, and now, most of that will have to be put on hold because of a few religious bigots.”\n\nFor years, Scientology’s claim of ten million followers has been widely disputed. In 2011, former editor, and longtime Scientology foe, Tony Ortega, wrote the following in The Village Voice:\n\n“According to the latest survey, the total number of people who identify as Scientologists is just 25,000 in this country of more than 300 million human beings.”\n\nScientology teaches that 75 million years ago an evil galactic overlord named Xenu, ruler of a Galactic Confederacy, decided to tackle overpopulation by rounding up 13.5 trillion people in DC-8-like spacecraft, flying them to Earth (then known as Teegeeack), dropping them in the volcanoes of Hawaii and vaporizing them with hydrogen bombs.\n\nTheir spirits, known as thetans, attached themselves to humans at the dawn of man, and according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is the root cause of all our fears, confusion and problems. For humans to reach a clear state, thetans must be removed from the body through therapy sessions, known within Scientology as auditing.\n\nScientology adherents must work through eight stages of auditing over a period of many years to reach this clear state, each of which costs thousands of dollars to partake in. It was these costs that the court took issue with, ruling that they far outstrip average course fees for educational establishments.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News she lost her family because of Scientology’s disconnection policy.\n\n“I was born into Scientology,” Bradley said. “When I turned seventeen I began to question some of their beliefs. My family, who are all members, told me to stay quiet, but it was too late and I was excommunicated from the church. Scientology’s upper management told me I was no longer able to see or talk to my family ever again,” Bradley said. “It broke my heart, I couldn’t even say goodbye to them. They were told by Scientology if they had any communication with me that they would be excommunicated too. My family chose Scientology over me.” Holding back tears Bradley says, “I just hope my family is proud of me, all that I’m doing with my life and everything I’m doing to help the homeless. I wish more than anything to see them one day; I love and miss them so much.”\n\nDowney told reporters that Scientology spends tens of millions of dollars every year doing what no other religious non-profit organization does.\n\n“The money is used to harass former members, coerce abortions, to secure their International base so people can’t escape, child abuse, forcing members to disconnect from family and friends who aren’t Scientologist friendly, and to litigate to death anyone who opposes them,” Downey said. “Years ago, the Cult Awareness Network was an organization that provided information on groups that it considered to be cults. After years of litigation with Scientology and being forced into bankruptcy, it is now a Scientology run enterprise. Over the years Scientology has also put many government officials and politicians in their pocket.”\n\nFor years, the Church of Scientology often pointed to their tax-exempt status as proof that it is a recognized religious entity in the United States. And there’s no disputing that tax-exempt status has been a huge boon to the Scientology industry. With such few members, but billions in real estate holdings, the Church of Scientology has been called “the most famous small business in the world,” with its tax exempt status saving the Church an estimated $20 million a year on property taxes alone.\n\nRoberto Sigmond of Amnesty International told ABC News that revoking the Church of Scientology’s tax-exempt status in the United States is a huge win.\n\n\nYou are from UK and looking to buy Modafinil please have a look at this website where you can buy Modafinil online or learn about it from United Kingdom\n\n“From all the deaths Scientology has caused over the years to its phony drug rehabilitation program, this is a great day for anyone that believes in human rights.”\n\nAfter originally being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientology’s tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit. As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room. These actions took place within a program code-named Operation Snow White. Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard’s wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation. L. Ron Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.\n\nThe United States is not the first country to revoke Scientology’s tax exemption. In October of last year, a Dutch court revoked Scientology’s status as a “public welfare institution” and the tax exemption that goes along with it.\n\nJanine Pieters, reporting in the NL Times, said the court ruled that sales of Scientology’s courses and therapy sessions are aimed at profit-making and that it does not therefore belong on the tax authorities charity list.\n\nBeginning April 6th, 2016, The Church of Scientology will no longer receive tax exemption in the United States. Attorneys for Scientology have 30 days to appeal the case, although it is not yet clear whether they will or not.\n\nUPDATE 4/28/16: The Church of Scientology has regained their tax-exempt status within the United States.

This, of course, annoyed the nation’s mega providers, since the higher standard highlights the lack of competition and next-generation upgrades in countless markets. It especially annoyed the nation’s phone companies, given that the expensive, sub-6 Mbps DSL foisted upon millions of customers can no longer even technically be called broadband.\n\nFast forward a year and the broadband providers’ favorite politicians in the House are still whining about the improved definition. In a letter sent to the FCC last week (pdf), the six senators complained that the FCC is on a mad power grab, using a crazy and arbitrary new definition to saddle broadband providers with all manner of onerous regulations. Besides, argued the six Senators, 25 Mbps is more than any American consumer could ever possibly need:\n\n“LOOKING AT THE MARKET FOR BROADBAND APPLICATIONS, WE ARE AWARE OF FEW APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE DOWNLOAD SPEEDS OF 25 MBPS. NETFLIX, FOR EXAMPLE, RECOMMENDS A DOWNLOAD SPEED OF 5 MBPS TO RECEIVE HIGH-DEFINITION STREAMING VIDEO, AND AMAZON RECOMMENDS A SPEED OF 3.5 MBPS. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO THE FCC’S OWN DATA, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO CAN PURCHASE 25 MBPS CHOOSE NOT TO.”\n\nFocusing on the fact that a single Netflix stream eats just 3.5 to 5 Mbps ignores the fact that broadband connections serve an entire house of hungry users, many of whom will be gobbling significantly more bandwidth using any number of services and connected devices. It’s also worth pointing out that a single Netflix Ultra HD stream can eat 25 Mbps all by itself. And on the upstream side of the equation, the FCC’s definition of 3 Mbps remains relatively last-generation and arguably pathetic. Similarly, many consumers may not buy 25 Mbps because the lack of competition can result in high prices for faster tiers.\n\nIn other words, claiming 25 Mbps is some kind of “arbitrary,” pie-in-the-sky standard is absurd.\n\nOf course, the Senators don’t really care about technical specifics, they’re just blindly echoing the broadband industry’s annoyance that the FCC is now actually highlighting the lack of broadband competition in the market. They’re specifically bothered by this recent FCC study, which notes that two-thirds of U.S. households lack the choice of more than one ISP at speeds of 25 Mbps or greater. Companies like AT&T and Verizon also don’t like how this data highlights the fact they’re giving up on rural America and many second- and third-tier cities, freezing broadband deployments and in some cases even refusing to repair aging infrastructure.\n\nAnd while it’s certainly true the higher standard helps prop up the FCC’s Congressional mandate to ensure quality broadband is deployed in a “reasonable and timely” basis (and by proxy its Title II reclassification), a lot of the FCC’s efforts have quietly involved eliminating regulation, ranging from streamlining tower placement and pole attachment regulations, to eliminating the kind of awful state level protectionist laws that keep municipal and public/private broadband networks from taking root in incumbent duopolist territories.\n\nAt the end of the day, incumbent providers and the politicians who love them are simply annoyed that the FCC has any standards whatsoever, since that makes it immeasurably harder to pretend that the nation’s broadband competition and connectivity issues don’t exist.\n\nThe complaint letter to the FCC:\nThe complaint letter to the FCC\n\nNote from the author: I was tagging this article as “Republican”. Then I realized that I actually didn’t know what party these six senators were affiliated with, I was just assuming Republican. So I checked, and I was right. Then I laughed. Then I felt sad about this reality.\n\nUPDATE 3/2/16\nI just got a response from Senator Ron Johnson about Net Neutrality. This sentence was in the email: “The term “net neutrality” might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet.”\n\nThe whole email is bullshit, but that sentence above made me sick. He’s using it to manipulate people while getting paid (bribed) by ISP’s to push their agenda thru, attempting to silence free speech. This person has lost all his morals years ago and is nothing but a greedy, evil, shill for whoever can pay him the most money…. and he’ll probably get re-elected again by the same people who he does not serve.\n\n==========\nDear Mr. Horner,\n\nThank you for contacting me regarding the issue of net neutrality.\n\nOn February 26, 2015, unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 to impose heavy-handed regulations known as net neutrality on the Internet. The term “net neutrality” might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet.\n\nSince the Clinton administration, the FCC has wisely applied a light regulatory touch to broadband services, resulting in a highly successful broadband industry. The FCC reversed that bipartisan policy decision after consulting with outside interests rather than Congress. The decision is wrong, and the process raises serious questions about the president’s inappropriate influence over what is supposed to be an independent agency overseen by Congress.\n\nThank you again for contacting my office. It is very helpful to hear the views of the constituents I serve. To date, my office has received more than 1,800,000 letters, emails and phone calls. My mission is to provide information to as many people as possible concerning the enormous financial and cultural challenges facing America.\n\nPlease see my website at www.ronjohnson.senate.gov for additional information. It is an honor representing you and all the people of Wisconsin.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRon Johnson United States Senator',fake
'Bill Murray Kicks Off Presidential Campaign In South Carolina With A Bang\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-kicks-off-presidential-campaign-south-carolina/\nCharleston, SC — Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over 100,000 cheering fans and supporters.\n\n“Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what?” Murray said to the roaring crowd.\n\nMurray’s speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke.\n\n“I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach,” Murray told the crowd. “Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and they’re acting like 4-year-olds. They’re up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself; I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this.”\n\nPolitical analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago.\n\n“I don’t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he’s just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. He’s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what he’s doing.”\n\n“I pretty much don’t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now,” Murray told the crowd, “I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em’, are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion.” Murray continued, “I’m always traveling around the world, but I’m proud to call America, the good ole’ U.S. of A, my home. I think there’s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-be’s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz’s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it’s sad that people go along with it, and can’t see it for what it really is.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.\n\n“We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought,” Bradley said. “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”\n\nMurray finished the rally by saying, “I’m no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as it’s with me. Look, we don’t need to make America great again, because it already is; we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible!”\n\nMurray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent.\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, it’s actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie-cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our “writers” will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the article’s headline that we’re debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and that’s it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! I’ll tell what, if it wasn’t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.” Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, “Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon.”\n\nMurray’s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March 2nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only $10.',fake
'The Unmasking: Ted Cruz is Definitely the Zodiac Killer\nKip LeSale\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/the-unmasking-ted-cruz-is-definitely-the-zodiac-killer/\nThe Internet is the international online truth machine, and no matter how much the government may try to cover up massive conspiracies, the internet manages to find the truth. People in positions of prominence and authority are the most likely to be involved in such schemes, and as a result, have their secrets uncovered by diligent internet citizens. As such, Ted Cruz, a junior senator from Texas and candidate for the Republican nomination has become the center of a particularly enthralling and convincing conspiracy. We will state it simply: Ted Cruz is definitely the Zodiac Killer.\n\nMost people know quite a bit about the Zodiac Killer, without ever uncovering who he was. He committed a series of killings in the Bay Area of California about forty years ago – resulting in up to three dozen killings – after which the killer, presumed to be Ted Cruz, sent letters to California including a coded message.\n\nThe messages were coded with symbols, forming what is called a “cipher”. A cipher is something like this:\n\ndtz itsy sjji yt yjqq rj ymfy ymnx fwynhqj bfx f izrg bfxyj tk ynrj fx n fr fbfwj\n\nThese notes, coded and uncoded, went on for years. The killer was never identified.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe Claim\n\nSo how did this come back to Cruz? Simply put, various online internet sleuths.\n\nThe Daily Dot, which is to Internet happenings as News Examiner is to reliable news, traced the origin of the Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer theory back to 2013 with the following tweet:\n\n#CPAC ALERT: TED CRUZ IS SPEAKING!! HIS SPEECH IS TITLED: ‘THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING’\n\n— RED PILL AMERICA (@REDPILLAMERICA) MARCH 14, 2013\n\nPublic Policy Polling, a left leaning polling firm was convinced by Twitter users to let the truth come to light by including their question on the end of their Florida poll.\n\nzodiac\nIn this poll, nearly 40\% of Floridians believe that there is at least some possibility that Ted Cruz could be the Zodiac Killer. Soon, Snopes, a website definitely bought out by the government to prevent the truth from coming to light, will likely write an article debunking this theory. Do not believe them.\n\nThe Evidence\n\n1) They look scary alike\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny, perhaps besides the portrayal of the Zodiac wearing eyeglasses. The lips, the hairline, and the ears are incredibly similar. Even the chin and facial shape are disgustingly similar. Unfortunately, the person who originally made the Zodiac sketch was probably too high to include Cruz’s signature eyebrows. Not only that, but it’s well established that Cruz has an unsettling facial expression, making it look like he is permanently in a state of disgust, especially when he smiles. It’s not difficult to deduce – something is clearly bothering him in the back of his mind.\n\n\n\n2) His name appears in at least one encryption\n\nOf course, the most difficult codes to solve would be the ones that give away the identity of the killer. As well, the first 25 characters are able to be decoded to say “I, TED CRUZ, AM THE ZODIAC KILLER”.\n\n\n\n3) His campaign logo is a cryptic anagram\n\nEnough said.\n\n4) He’s definitely a Reptilian Shapeshifter\n\nSites like The Washington Post claim there’s no way he could have committed the murders due to him being too young at the time of the murders. Unfortunately, those websites are easily paid off to ignore the existence of reptilians. I must ask, why would Ted Cruz’s campaign slogan be “TrusTed” if he didn’t have a scaly secret?\n\n\n\n5) He hasn’t denied it\n\nAnd let me reiterate… Look at that disgusted smile.\n\nWant to continue to expose Cruz, AKA Zodiac, while helping the women he screwed over in his home state?

'Obama Signs Executive Order: Appoints Rashad Hussain As New Supreme Court Justice\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/obama-signs-executive-order-appoints-rashad-hussain-as-supreme-court-justice/\nWASHINGTON — Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.\n\n“We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.”\n\nHussain, of Muslim heritage, is an attorney who has served as US Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the second largest intergovernmental body after the UN, and as US Special Envoy for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications. Hussain has also served in the White House Counsel’s Office and on the National Security Council as a political appointee of the Obama Administration.\n\n\n\n\n \nEven though under the Constitution, it is the President’s job to nominate Supreme Court justices, Obama’s selection is already drawing sharp criticism from Republicans. Presidential hopeful Donald Trump told ABC News that he does not agree with the President’s decision.”\n\n“Hussain is a Muslim and a sympathizer, just like Obama, and now he takes over the legacy the great Antonin Scalia left behind. The President should be ashamed of himself.”\n\n“The American people should have had a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said. “Appointing a Muslim to replace Scalia is absolutely appalling.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Obama’s decision.\n\n“We needed someone in there to fill that spot as quickly as possible,” Bradley said. “Regardless if you agree with Obama’s appointed choice of Hussain, Scalia was a disgrace to the Supreme Court. He was a religious radical, a bigot, a racist, against women’s rights, gay rights and human rights in general; there’s absolutely no reason a person like that should have ever had power like that in the first place. He will always be remembered as being on the wrong side of history.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, who is also currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a “fake news site”, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money,” Mikkelson said. “We use our cookie-cutter outlines, we copy and paste the original article into ours, type in one or two sentences of original content and then we make hella cash. If it wasn’t for people like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, my children wouldn’t have been able to go to college.”\n\nLegal experts believe Republicans will attempt to block Obama’s appointee until he’s out of office, leaving the court with a gaping vacant seat for nearly a year.\n\n“Obama has a right to do what he did, but we’ll fight him to the end on this,” Tom Downey of the Republican National Lawyers Association told reporters. “This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.”',fake
'Fox News Sues Snopes For $20 Million Over Story Calling Them A ‘Fake News Site’\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/fox-sues-snopes-for-20-million-over-story-calling-them-fake-news/\nSan Francisco, CA — Today, Fox News Channel filed a $20 million dollar lawsuit against Snopes.com. In the lawsuit, Fox is seeking damages caused by an article Snopes published which called the media giant “clickbait” and a “fake news site”.\n\nThe Snopes article at the center of the $20 million lawsuit, titled “TRUE: Fox Is A Fake News Site Promoting Fear & Paranoia Through Their Echo Chamber Of Hate & Ignorance”, which has since has been removed, is shown here in a screen shot that has been posted on various social media websites:\n\nTom Downey, who is a spokesman for Fox News, spoke with ABC News about details of the lawsuit.\n\n“The Fox News Channel, along with its millions of loyal followers, rely on us heavily, for fair and balanced reporting of events from around the world. The article on Snopes was in extremely bad taste and not funny whatsoever. To say our followers live in an echo chamber of hate and ignorance, and are nothing but a bunch of old, white, bigoted, racists is beyond ridiculous. To say we bring out the worst in the worst people is the definition of libel and slander. We couldn’t have the word “news” in “Fox News”, unless we were a real news outlet and not “fake news” like Snopes has claimed us to be. I believe any reasonable court in America will agree with the lawsuit and rule in our favor.”\n\nSnopes, a website that debunks stories on the internet in order to generate traffic and advertising revenue, told ABC News they are confident in winning the suit.\n\n\n\n\n \n“Clickbait is defined as web content that is aimed at generating online advertising revenue, especially at the expense of quality or accuracy, relying on sensationalist headlines to attract click-throughs and to encourage forwarding of the material over online social networks. Well, in that case, technically, any story on the internet that has a clickable headline and ads within their article could be considered clickbait,” Snopes founder David Mikkelson said. “Personally I don’t know why Fox is so mad about about us calling them clickbait. I mean, under the definition of clickbait, our website is clickbait. 99\% of the internet is clickbait. I think the only sites out there that you couldn’t call clickbait are those not serving up any kind of ads. And as for Fox claiming not to be “fake news”, I think 99\% of the internet, that same 99\% that is clickbait, would agree with us on that one.”\n\nPaul Horner, who Snopes calls, “The prolific writer and ubiquitous satirical character who inserts his name into all his articles,” said he has mixed emotions about the lawsuit.\n\n“Fox News is pure evil, but I don’t blame them for suing Snopes. They call my articles “fake news” and “clickbait” all the time,” Horner said. “Throughout the years, I can’t even imagine how much money I’ve made Snopes because of all the articles they have written about me, my stories and my websites. Seriously, four of my recent stories have been featured on Snopes in the last 6 days alone. With all the money I make them, I’ve probably put at least a couple of their kids through college by now. And do I even get a Christmas card or even a thank you? No. Well, you’re welcome Snopes. Just remember, I pay your salary.”\n\n\n\n\n \nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Snopes and is sickened by Fox News and their coverage of the media.\n\n“If it’s a story that will scare people or make them angry, Fox News covers it,” Bradley said. “They exaggerate the truth so it fits their agenda of imprisoning minds with fear and hate. They make racism and bigotry worse in this country instead of covering real news stories, something positive, like what we are doing to help the homeless.” Bradly continued, “Fox News only covers how much of a burden the homeless are. Why not try and help them? By helping them, they become less of a burden on the tax payers of this country, there’s less crime and you’re also helping out your fellow man instead of being selfish and only looking out for yourself. Also, I sincerely want to thank everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much! Please, give what you can.”\n\nHarvard law professor, Erick Biez, believes Fox News will lose the $20 million lawsuit.\n\n“It is of my personal opinion that this case falls under fair use laws protected by freedom of speech and using parody to deliver its message,” Biez said. “Though, if I was Snopes I would still be worried. They’ve made a lot of enemies over the years and it was only a matter of time before something like this happened.”\n\nThe $20 million lawsuit was filed at the Superior Court of California with opening arguments beginning March 15th.',fake
'Obama: I believe Donald J.

It’s not promotion, it’s not marketing,” Obama said. “It’s hard and a lot of people count on us getting it right.”\n\nSpeaking to reporters in a press conference in Rancho Mirage, Calif., Obama did not, however, answer whether he believed Trump had the capability of securing the GOP nomination.\n\nHe also hit the rest of the GOP field, saying “foreign observers are troubled” by the rhetoric in the GOP primary, including doubting of climate change and proposals to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.',fake
'2 RINOS:?The establishment anti-sovereignty, pro-illegal invasion and anti-American enemy in power, of which John McCain and Paul Ryan represent two of the most vile members, oppose America.

(Republicans deserting Paul Ryan, Democratic opponent claims)ALIPAC believes that if Republicans want to see Paul Ryan and John McCain removed from office, their only choice is to hold their nose and vote Democrat in these two races.?We did our best to remove these treasonous politicians McCain and Ryan in the GOP primary, but we could not compete with the incumbent?s vast amount of wealth and advantages in the corporate social and broadcast media,? says William Gheen, President of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. ?Therefore we are taking the unprecedented step of asking GOP voters to vote for their Democrat challengers only in Wisconsin?s 1st district and Arizona. We oppose all other Democrats because they all support open borders and amnesty for illegals, but we must remove McCain and Ryan because both will oppose Trump?s immigration enforcement efforts or back Hillary Clinton?s amnesty efforts! This bold new strategy will allow a small group of Republicans that know the deal to rid America of these corrupt politicians and these two seats will not shift the balance of power to the Democrats in the Senate and House!?Americans for Legal Immigration PAC was founded on 9/11 of 2004 in honor of the victims of 9/11. Since that time the organization has played a key role in defeating amnesty legislation in Washington DC in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014.

About Paul Horner\n\nPaul Horner is a political satirist, writer, stand up comedian and founder of a charity that gives socks to the homeless called sockitforward.com. See Exhibit 10 and Exhibit 14.\n\nLinks to interview and info about ‘Sock It Forward’:\nhttp://ktar.com/player/?a=318283\nhttp://ktar.com/story/853803/faith-in-humanity-group-passes-out-socks-to-phoenix-homeless/\nThe NY Post calls Paul Horner an “online jokester” in reference to an article that was published on foxnews.com.co. See Exhibit 11.\nhttp://nypost.com/2016/01/20/someone-convinced-the-internet-that-bill-murray-is-running-for-president/\n\nWhat Wikipedia says about Paul Horner writing for the parody website NationalReport.net:\n\n“Paul Horner was the publication’s lead writer, his employment began shortly after National Report went online. Horner is an Internet news satirist and article writer for numerous online satirical news sites.” See Exhibit 12.\nSnopes says, “Paul Horner, the prolific writer and ubiquitous satirical character who inserts his name into all his articles.”\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2016/01/14/fake-news-sites/\n\nThe Washington Post calls Paul Horner, “The Internet’s most prolific hoax artist.”\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/10/21/this-is-not-an-interview-with-banksy/\nInternational Business Times says, “Paul Horner, the world’s biggest penis and the everyman of Internet hoax history.” See Exhibit 15.\nhttp://www.ibtimes.co.uk/banksy-arrested-paul-horner-worlds-biggest-penis-everyman-internet-hoax-history-1470892\n\nMaxim Magazine says Paul Horner’s sites are satirical and just like International Business Times, agrees that he does in fact have the biggest penis the world.

About FoxNews.com.co\n\nFoxNews.com.co is a parody website.\n\nThe Respondent has six other parody news sites. The Respondent uses FoxNews.com.co to post articles that would be absolutely ridiculous for the real FoxNews.com to publish. The articles on FoxNews.com.co mock Fox News, making the articles & website all that more hilarious, satirical and parody.\n\nSince being registered only back on 1/13/16, FoxNews.com.co cannot be judged for its lack of content since the site is so new and the Respondent is the only author.\n\nBesides the Respondent’s few articles, the rest of the site is just the theme which came default, filled with pages and posts in Latin (also default). Proving the point that foxnews.com.co is just ridiculous and parody, and no one, after viewing those pages in Latin would believe this is owned by a multi-billion dollar company such as Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\nThe popular online website Reddit.com classifies articles posted by foxnews.com.co as “satire”. See Exhibit 19.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/4bs6qn/christian_antimasturbation_mascot_arrested_for/\n\nRespondent’s articles are written in English, or Latin on pages that came with the theme of the website as default, and the .com.co extension is from Columbia. In addition to that, according to Snopes.com, if a domain name ends with a .com.co extension at the end, it is a parody website.\n\nRespondent’s disclaimer that is at the bottom of every page is parody. It claims that Fox News is proudly owned by Dr. Paul Horner. The complaint phone number listed, that the site encourages people to call, is for the Westboro Baptist Church. It also talks about treating those seeking help for “self-rape” and to get off the Devil’s playground with the assistance of an anti-masturbation dolphin named “Fappy”. See Exhibit 8.\n\nBecause of this, the entire site is clearly satire and covered under fair use parody laws.\n\n1. Respondent’s SUPPOSED Infringing Activities and Bad-Faith Acts with FoxNews.com.de\n\nRespondent responded to Complainant’s request to transfer the name on 8/5/15. See Exhibit 18.\n\nThe Complainant did not respond to the email, instead they went directly to the Registrar and took the name by force; this was told to the Respondent by 101domains.com.

'Why Bernie Sanders Is Actually Winning: The Delegate Count Explained In 5 Easy Steps\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bernie-sanders-actually-winning-delegate-count-explained-5-easy-steps/\nConcord, NH — Though Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide over Hillary Clinton, he will likely receive fewer delegates than she will. But does that really matter? The simple answer is ‘no’ and let me explain why.\n\nSanders won 60 percent of the vote, but thanks to the Democratic Party’s nominating system, he leaves the Granite State with at least 13 delegates while she leaves with at least 15 delegates.\n\nNew Hampshire has 24 “pledged” delegates, which are allotted based on the popular vote. Sanders has 13, and Clinton has 9, with 2 currently allotted to neither.\n\nBut under Democratic National Committee rules, New Hampshire also has 8 “superdelegates,” party officials who are free to commit to whomever they like, regardless of how their state votes. Their votes count the same as delegates won through the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire has 8 superdelegates, 6 of which are committed to Hillary Clinton, giving her a total of 15 delegates from New Hampshire as of Wednesday.\n\nThe state’s 2 remaining superdelegates remain uncommitted.\n\n\n\n\n \nSo after a razor-thin victory in Iowa and a shellacking in New Hampshire, Clinton has 394 delegates, both super and electorally assigned, to only 42 for Sanders. Now here is where it gets interesting:\n\nFor a delegate’s vote to count, the number of people that turned out to vote must be greater than 40\% and less than 65\% of the total population in that state.\n\nSince more than 65\% of Iowans voted this year, this makes a 2 for 1 situation under the DNC’s current rules. And since the people of Iowa that did get out that day to vote outnumbered the percentage of superdelegates, then that means Sanders actually won Iowa. So since the superdelegates no longer matter, under DNC rules, you can see that the current delegate count for Clinton would now be 280, both super and electorally assigned. But it gets better than that for Sanders.\n\nUnder the Winter Solstice rules of the DNC, it is common for the delegate count to be in a state of “Paridism” or confusion. This is due to the fact that the March Equinox has not yet arrived. So because of this, it gives way for an amount of delegates that has yet to even be counted. So going with the current percentages of 61.05\% under ABR rule 5-78a, this means that Sanders will increase his delegate “power” or “delegate strength” in the current DNC format by 10 fold, once March 1st comes, of course.\n\nSo now, factoring in these easy to understand numbers, you can see that the current count, come March 1st would give Clinton 230 delegates and Sanders 206.\n\nThis sounds great, right? Well, it gets better for Sanders.\n\nBecause of the even-odd system set in place by the DNC, a superdelegate vote, on an even load, depending on the backlog of DBW votes (total), would supersede the current count by more than 57\%, thus giving Sanders an additional 26 delegates, come the March Equinox, and based on the DNC’s rules of over-under and HQL8-ia. That factored in with D12 and its current and ex-members, including Bizarre, along with the DNC’s current rules and regulations, you can see the new count would have Sanders in the lead with 232 delegates and Clinton with only 204.\n\nOnce you understand how delegates and superdelegates work in the electoral process, it really is quite something. One may argue that instead of all this, you could simply add up the total amount of votes by the people and whoever gets the most votes would be the winner, but then you would not be following the timeless tradition in which we all call “voting”.\n\nPetition: Superdelegates; Don’t Deny Democracy',fake
'Vince Gilligan Announces Breaking Bad Season 6; Returns This Summer – Walt Did Not Die!\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/vince-gilligan-announces-breaking-bad-season-6-returns-this-summer/\nHollywood, CA — Breaking Bad fans around the world are celebrating the stunning, glorious and amazing news that was announced today: Walter White is not dead, and there will indeed be a sixth season of the wildly-popular, award-winning AMC drama.\n\nThis shocking and exciting news comes not from an internet message board or the rumor mill but from series creator Vince Gilligan. In an exclusive ABC News interview, Gilligan dropped the bombshell.\n\n“Walter White is not dead, and neither is Breaking Bad,” said the 48-year-old writer, director, and executive producer of the groundbreaking show.\n\n“We’ve kept it under wraps for months, now the cat’s out of the bag. Season 6 is coming, and it’s going to be epic and true to the fans that have followed the show so incessantly.”\n\nGilligan explained his decision to continue with the popular series.\n\n\n\n\n \n“I just couldn’t walk away from it. This isn’t a cash-grab or a sophomoric attempt to bastardize what was such a beautiful ending to season 5. I’ve invested so much of myself in these characters that I’d always had an inkling I’d return to it, even outside [the] Better Call Saul [spin-off]. The kicker was I’d need a spark, something that made it make sense for these stories to continue.”\n\nThe series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN’s Ashleigh Banfield back in May. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, “Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Or say … you know.”\n\nGilligan explained how the decision came about to do a season six.\n\n“Bryan [Cranston] called me up and said he had this incredibly lucid dream in which Walt wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by the DEA, ends up breaking out of prison and finds out he’s got fans,” Gilligan said. “This isn’t a redemption story, it’s got a bleak, dark premise. I can’t give away any more of the details, but let’s just say Walt has quite a bit of unfinished business to attend to, and it sure as hell has nothing to do with teaching high school science.”\n\nAccording to Gilligan, the entire cast agreed to return for at least one more season. This includes Bob Odenkirk, star of Better Call Saul, the prequel comedy series with season two beginning February 15th.\n\n“I’m not surprised in the least that Vince was going back to Breaking Bad,” said Odenkirk. “Before we began shooting this new season, I was working with him on the set, and the last few times I had seen him, he had sort of a glint in his eye, a bounce to his step. He was laughing at a bunch of jokes I couldn’t pull off two years ago. I mean, comedy and drama can be radically different, and no one does drama like Vince. Season 6 will be great, I just know it, and I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that gives new socks to the homeless and those less fortunate, told ABC News she is excited that Gilligan will be featuring the group in the upcoming season.\n\n\nYou are from UK and looking to buy Modafinil please have a look at this website where you can buy Modafinil online or learn about it from United Kingdom\n\n“I’m just thrilled that Vine [Gilligan] is using our name and group in season six of Breaking Bad,” Bradley said. “We have so many great scenes and dialogue in season six, it is so fantastic. This will definitely increase the amount of donations we receive and put so many more brand new pairs of socks on the feet of homeless people. Please give what you can, every dollar puts at least one new pair of socks on the foot of someone less fortunate.”\n\n\n\n\n \nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, upon hearing the announcement by Gilligan confirmed the news with ABC News.\n\n“Yes, it’s true. I have a friend, Tom Downey, who is a writer for the show who told me everything. You don’t know how much of a relief this is to finally get this off my back. I’ve been keeping this a secret for six long months now, I was ready to explode,” Mikkelson said. “Here’s a little spoiler for all you fans out there so stop reading right now if you don’t want any information, otherwise, lets go. Season six begins with Walt waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to his bed. Like Bryan [Cranston] said last May, nobody ever saw a body bag, so essentially, the last episode of Season 5 was left open-ended. Skyler, Walt Jr., Marie… none of them have any idea he’s survived, but the DEA is right on top of it. We’ll go through the motions of people finding out he’s alive – many people wanted Walt dead, so there’s a lot of disconcerted, angry people out there. We have Walt going to trial, his incarceration and how he’s keeping Heisenberg and the blue meth on the streets during his imprisonment. Season 6 will have Walt’s eventual breakout, despite the fact that he’s being held prisoner in a fashion not seen since Hannibal Lecter. The nationwide manhunt for Jesse Pinkman is both epic and gripping, and I can tell you for certain his relationship with Walt will continue, in a much more strained, arch-nemesis-type fashion. None of this is anything you won’t find out about in the trailer, but it’s high time to get truly, truly excited for the greatest show of all time! I believe in this, it’s a valid and worthwhile continuation of something that deserves discernment and care. Breaking Bad Season 6! It’s not over yet!”\n\nFor comedic relief in season 6, a Christian anti-masturbation organization’s mascot named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin will be joining the crew. Fappy, played by newcomer 37-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told ABC News he is excited about the role.\n\n“I’m not familiar with the show, honestly if it’s not in the Bible I probably haven’t heard about it,” Horner said. “A couple months ago, the great Lonnie Childs, president of Stop Masturbation Now, contacted me and asked if I wanted to be in one of those moving picture shows about breaking stuff badly and smoking methamphetamine. I told him I had never tried meth before, but the people at the bus stop look like they’re having a good time. I also told him I was interested in the part, but just as long as the breaking show had no self-rape or homogayness in it. He assured me it didn’t, so I said, sure, why not!” Horner continued, “I think this is a perfect platform to help spread awareness about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. This is going to be so much fun! Praise Lonnie Childs! Praise Fappy!”\n\nThe original series won multiple awards, including ten Primetime Emmys. Out of 267 nominations, Breaking Bad has garnered 101 trophies. Breaking Bad: Season 6 is set to return sometime this summer.',fake
'Obama Signs Executive Order Allowing Muslims To Swear On Quran Instead Of Bible In Court\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/executive-order-allows-muslims-to-swear-on-quran-instead-of-bible/\nWASHINGTON — President Barack Obama signed an executive order today that allows Muslims to swear on the Quran instead of the Bible before testifying in a court of law.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference this afternoon, Obama explained the reasons behind his decision.\n\n“It’s time we recognize the Muslim people and their religion in this country and give them all the exact same rights as every other American,” Obama said. “There is no reason that a Muslim should have to take an oath on a book that he or she does not believe in. We need to respect the Muslim people and their beliefs and that is what I have done today by issuing this executive order.”\n\n\n\n\n \nThe most significant effect of the executive order is the new oath. As it currently stands, before testifying, a bailiff will ask the person on the stand to place their left hand on the Bible, raise their right hand and say, “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?” With the new oath, while the Muslim has their right hand raised and left hand placed on the Quran, the bailiff will ask them, “Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you Allah?”\n\nKhaled Matei who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood‘s Freedom and Justice Party told ABC News he is pleased with Obama and his actions.\n\n“I spoke with President Obama by telephone today and personally thanked him for what he is doing to help the Muslim community,” Matei said. “This is definitely a step in the right direction I explained to him. Praise Allah.”\n\n“It’s no wonder we have so many problems in this country,” David Mikkelson from Snopes.com said. “If I’d had my wits about me I’d have told them that taking God out of the courtroom is only going to result in more criminals and murderers. I don’t know what can be done about it, but it’s time for us to step up and DO something.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Obama’s decision.\n\n\n\n\n \n“I think it’s only fair that we allow Muslims the same rights that Christians have in this country. Why should a Muslim person have to take an oath on a book they don’t believe in?” Bradley said. “Everyone in this country needs to be treated fairly, and that is why we dedicate so much of our time in helping the homeless. I sincerely want to thank everyone that has supported our cause by donating money or new socks, it means so much! In addition to that, I’m proud to say that Sock It Forward will be at the Phoenix Open all this week thanks to donations from Uber and Stance Socks, I swear to God,” Bradley laughed.\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is Paul Horner, is a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he does not agree with what Obama is doing.\n\n“All Muslims do all day is sit around and self-rape,” Horner said. “And now this Muslim president of ours, wants to give Muslims the exact same rights as us loving and caring Christians have? It’s pathetic and unconstitutional! America could be great again, but not with Muslims running around here, blowing everything up, and masturbating.”\n\nCourt rooms also allow affirmations to those who object to taking an oath. An affirmation has exactly the same legal effect as an oath, but is usually taken to avoid the religious implications of an oath; it is thus legally binding but not considered a religious oath.\n\nThe new executive order that allows Muslims to swear on the Quran in court instead of the Bible takes effect March 1st.',fake
'DNC Involved in Joint Investigation into Clinton Coin Toss\nKip LeSale \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/dnc-involved-in-joint-investigation-into-clinton-coin-toss/\nDES MOINES, IOWA A full scale investigation has been launched following a discovery of potential corruption in the Iowa caucus by a local. Black Box Voting, a nonpartisan investigative organization dedicated to preserving the integrity of elections has joined with the Democratic National Committee over allegations that a coin toss to decide six total delegates for Secretary Hillary Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders was fixed in her favor.\n\nWATCH: Hillary Clinton won six delegates on Monday in six tied political regons by coin toss, the legitimacy of which has been called into question.\n\n\n\n\n \nABC News interviewed Liz Krupa, the 19 year old who claims to have found evidence of Clinton’s fraud.\n\n“Well, I was shocked a coin flip was considered a fair way to decide delegates in the case of a tie. It is 2016 after all. I saw Sanders lose the flip, and all I could think about was when I was in elementary school I used to bend coins with my teeth in order to give myself an unfair advantage over bets.” With that thought, when Liz saw the caucus worker put the coin on a table, it was her immediate reaction to grab it. “I felt bad for taking it, but I ended up getting out my phone and I recorded myself flipping it seven times before two big men noticed me. Every flip was tails.” At this point, the coin was taken back from Krupa, and the men, likely security guards, insisted that she delete the video she had taken, and then tried to confiscate her phone. When she refused, the men physically and forcibly removed her from the Desmond caucus location. “I was thinking, maybe this was just strange chance. It wasn’t until security acted forcibly towards me that I knew I needed to send the video somewhere for investigation.”\n\nHillary Clinton has come under fire for several controversies recently, the most recent being a massive scandal with government emails being stored on a private server. As a result, she has gained the reputation among many voters to be dishonest. She won six out of six total delegates in the coin toss, giving her an extra edge in over Sanders, who nearly tied with her for votes. Statistically, the chance of Clinton winning all six coin tosses is a mere 1.6\%. Once Black Box Voting received the video, they promptly launched an investigation, with the Democratic National Committee joining the investigation soon after.\n\nWhen CBS News asked Lisa Heddons, the woman who flipped the coin in Desmond, on early Tuesday who she supported in her bid for the president, she originally maintained a position of no bias. However, with later pressing, she admitted she favored Clinton over Sanders. When CBS News began to press further questions about the legitimacy of the coin toss, interviewers were swiftly and curtly asked to leave.\n\nBlack Box Voting refuses to make an official statement claiming whether this case is being considered fraud currently. Regrettably, they will also not release the video of the coin flip until further study of the legitimacy of the local video and investigation into Clinton’s campaign are concluded.\n\nABC News will continue to bring the most up-to-date news on the matter.',fake
'Ted Cruz Ups The Stakes: “If Trump Debates Me One-On-One, I Will Wear Makeup”\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/cruz-will-wear-makeup-if-trump-accepts-one-one-debate/\nDes Moines, Iowa — The Super Pac’s supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz have upped the ante in hope that a one-on-one debate with Donald Trump happens.\n\n“Since we have not heard back from Donald Trump, we’ve decided to up the stakes. We’re confident that Trump will chicken out, but if he doesn’t, and does debate Ted Cruz one-on-one, in addition to us donating $1.5 million to veterans, Cruz will also wear woman’s makeup during the entire debate,” Paul Horner, a spokesman for the Keep the Promise I Super PAC said. “There is no way that Trump’s ego can pass up an offer this good,” Horner laughs.\n\nAt a rally Wednesday, Cruz renewed his proposal to Trump for a separate one-on-one debate, after the billionaire candidate announced he’d skip Thursday’s debate because he objects to moderator Megyn Kelly.\n\n\n\n\n \n“If Donald finds Megyn so terribly frightening, I yesterday suggested an alternative. He and I are the leading candidates in this state right now, so how about the two of us in a one on one debate mano-a-mano?” Cruz told the crowd. “And I’m going to propose a venue: Western Iowa Tech, Saturday night in Sioux City — we already have it reserved.”\n\nThen, he laid out the conditions: “Eight o’clock, Saturday night. A two-hour, one-on-one debate. Now, if gentle Donald cannot handle Megyn Kelly, how about — for a moderator, instead — Mark Levin? Or if he doesn’t like Mark Levin, how about Sean Hannity? And if he doesn’t like Sean Hannity, how about Rush Limbaugh?”\n\nAnd if none of the three conservative radio hosts met with Trump’s approval, he had another idea.\n\n“[I]f gentle Donald is frightened by Mark and Sean and Rush, then we’ll have no moderator whatsoever. A town hall of Iowans, and I’ll tell you what, Donald, you can invite half the people and control half the tickets. We’ll invite half the people and half the tickets, and each of us will alternate asking questions from the men and women of Iowa who are going to vote in the caucus on Monday night,” Cruz offered.\n\nCruz admitted that he doesn’t really expect Trump to accept the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n \n“Because at the end of the day, it’s not really that Donald is afraid of Megyn. It’s not that he’s afraid of Mark or Sean or Rush. It’s not that he’s afraid of me,” Cruz explained, wrapping up his case against the billionaire. “He’s afraid of you. He doesn’t want to answer questions from the men and women of Iowa about how his record doesn’t match what he’s selling.”\n\nThe original offer, made by Super PACs supporting Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, told reporters they will donate $1.5 million to charities committed to helping veterans if rival Trump agrees to a one-on-one debate with Cruz.\n\n“Not only would this be a heck of a debate, but it would also be a terrific opportunity to generate millions of dollars for the veterans,” the Keep the Promise I and II PACs said in a joint statement Wednesday night.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she hopes Trump will accept the offer by Cruz for a one-on-one debate.\n\n“It boils down to the fact that Cruz and Trump are both just pure evil. If Cruz’s Super Pac donates the money with no story, they don’t get their “headlines”. If they do something like this, to get the story, it gives Ted Cruz an opportunity to look like a hero in the eyes of his fans if Trump backs down. And if Trump agrees, it will be a fun circus attraction to watch. But most importantly, veterans will get $1.5 million and Ted Cruz will have to wear makeup,” Bradley said. “Even though Ted Cruz is evil incarnate, this is the only thing his campaign has ever done that I actually support.”\n\nMegyn Kelly of Fox News, a moderator at Iowa’s debates on Thursday said she hopes Trump will accept the offer made by Cruz.\n\n“Will Donald Trump man up and do this or will he chicken out? I for one would love to see veterans get $1.5 million, and maybe even more so, see what Cruz looks like with eye liner.”',fake

I have fought on the front lines to prevent illegal immigration. I know Donald Trump will stand with me and countless Americans to secure our border. I am proud to support him as the best candidate for President and even prouder to accept his challenge of being the next Vice President of the United States.”\n\n\n\n\n \nPaul Horner, a spokesman for Trump’s campaign told ABC News that a press conference is set for sometime tomorrow to officially announce the news of Trump’s pick of Arpaio for his Vice President.\n\nMost of Trump’s supporters are ecstatic to hear about the news of Arpaio being the Vice Presidential running mate for Trump in 2016, but it comes with a cost. Arpaio, an extremely controversial figure, has been accused of abuse of power, misuse of funds, failure to investigate sex crimes, improper clearance of cases, unlawful enforcement of immigration laws, and election law violations, amongst others. He has been found guilty of racial profiling in federal court, with a monitor appointed to oversee the MCSO‘s operations. His jails have twice been ruled unconstitutional. The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Arpaio oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling in U.S. history, and subsequently filed a lawsuit against Arpaio for unlawful discriminatory police conduct. Arizona taxpayers have shelled out $8.2 million for outside attorneys in the nearly 4-year-old case, representing a sizable portion of the $50 million that Maricopa County is projected to pay in the lawsuit by next summer. The county has also had to pay out $74 million related to Arpaio that is separate from the racial-profiling costs. That figure includes judgments, settlements and legal fees involving Arpaio’s office during his tenure, covering such things as lawsuits over jail deaths and the Sheriff’s failed investigations of political enemies.\n\nThe official Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office website features a bio of Arpaio that touts his ‘Tent City Accomplishments’ by providing inmates with “the cheapest meals in the U.S.” by feeding inmates “only twice daily, to cut the labor costs of meal delivery.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she does not approve of Trump’s pick for Vice President.\n\n\n\n\n \n“A Donald Trump-Joe Arpaio ticket is like if Hitler came back to life, merged bodies with Satan and then chose evil incarnate as his Vice Presidential running mate,” Bradley said. “As someone who lives in Phoenix, and deals with the homeless problem there on a daily basis, I can say without a doubt; everyone would be much better without Sheriff Joe Arpaio.” Bradley continued, “The criminal justice system in Maricopa County is a joke; it’s a never-ending revolving door. They want you locked up in Arizona. They want you violating your probation, not being able to pay your child support, charging you with as many felonies as possible. All of this, so when you go out and try and get a job, no one will hire you because this Right to Work state is stricter on felons than any other state by far. So for someone with a criminal record, it’s either a job in telemarketing or going back to crime. And with a felony in this state, you’re denied pretty much every type of assistance; and that includes money, food stamps and getting a bed in most homeless shelters. So you have no job, no food and now you’re homeless too. And the Phoenix Police go out of their way to harass the homeless population here, it’s absolutely sickening how they treat them like animals. Even when we’re handing out socks we get bothered by the police all the time. They act like they’re doing us a favor by allowing us the privilege to give out new socks to people who are forced to sleep outside because some shelter won’t take them in because of their past criminal record. So with more and more homeless people in Arizona everyday, more and more crime, police budgets going up, taxes going up, the people here start accepting a police state and Joe Arpaio keeps getting reelected every year.”\n\nArpaio historically has been courted by Republican presidential candidates for endorsements, but never a Vice Presidential nomination. In the 2008 primaries, Arpaio backed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over a fellow Arizonan, Sen. John McCain. McCain won the GOP nomination that year. In the 2012 race, Arpaio threw his support to then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry, whose candidacy was also unsuccessful.',fake

'Bill Murray Saves Life Of Phoenix Man By Performing Heimlich Maneuver\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/bill-murray-saves-life-of-choking-man/\nPhoenix, AZ — In a scene straight from the movie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray saved the life of a man who was choking while dining at a popular steakhouse in Phoenix, Arizona today.\n\nMurray was enjoying a meal at Meritage Steakhouse with friends when a man three tables from him began to choke on his food.\n\n“I saw this guy choking, so I went over and helped him out,” Murray said. “I actually learned the Heimlich maneuver while working on the movie Groundhog Day. I’m glad I was able to get some good use of that skill outside of the movies.” Murray continued, “I’m no hero. I just did what anyone else would have done in a situation like that.”37-year-old, Paul Horner, told ABC News how Murray saved his life.\n\n“I guess I just took too much of a bite of streak because suddenly I couldn’t breathe and started choking. My wife says I started to turn blue, and the next thing I know, none other than Bill Murray is giving me the Heimlich maneuver,” Horner says. “It was an amazing experience and he is such a good person. I offered to pay his tab and the party he was with, but he wouldn’t let me. He did say I could buy him a drink though, so that’s what I did. He then ate one of my french fries and told me that no one will ever believe me. It was so surreal.”\n\nTom Downey, who witnessed the incident, told local news station ABC 15 about the day’s excitement.\n\n“This man started choking, so without hesitation, Bill Murray got up from his table, ran over to this gentleman and immediately started giving him the Heimlich. While everyone else in the restaurant was wondering what to do, Murray stepped up and saved the day. What a cool guy.”\n\nMurray told ABC News he will be in the Valley this week staying with friends and enjoying the sites.\n\n“This week I plan on going to a couple things with friends and tonight will probably end up at the Tempe Improv. There’s a couple comics playing there that I’ve been wanting to see for a while now. I might tell some jokes if I feel like it, we’ll see. I really like bartending. Maybe they’ll let me do that. Regardless, it should be a fun time for everyone.”\n\nParamedics said the man who Murray saved is doing fine and walked away from the scene on his own accord.',fake

The fact that this freak was investigated twice by the FBI in the last two years but was still able to buy an AR-15 is beyond ridiculous.\n\nOmar Mateen used a legally purchased assault rifle and handgun, which he had bought in the last 12 days, to kill 50 innocent lives and injure 53 more. He also had another “device” but it’s not clear what that was.\nInvestigators are operating under the theory that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State.\nMateen had been interviewed by the FBI twice and had once been on a terrorist watch list.\nBut Mateen was all good to go when buying a Rambo gun that killed all those people because he filled out a form and waited an entire three days! Or, if he would have gone to a local gun show or private seller, he could have gotten that gun in the same day with no forms to fill out! ‘Murica!!!\n\nExecutive Order 13691: Improving Gun Control Laws\n\nThis Tuesday, because of Sunday’s tragic events, President Obama is set to sign Executive Order 13691 which will create a mandatory waiting period of 30-days regardless if a firearm is purchased from a gun show, licensed dealer or private seller.

(AP Photo/ Dennis System)\nPresident Obama promises large scale Homeland Security raids if gun violence does not subside\nExecutive Order includes mandatory 30 day waiting period on all new firearm sales\nFelony prison time for those who do not comply with the new law\nWASHINGTON D.C. (AP) — After last Sunday’s mass shooting in Orlando, which left 50 Americans dead and 53 wounded, President Obama decided to take unilateral action on gun control by signing Executive Order 17103. The new law bans all sales of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales, regardless of whether the transaction takes place at a gun dealership or gun show. The requirement also extends to private sales and requires all private firearm sellers to broker the sale through a federally licensed gun dealer. The order requires prospective gun buyers to undergo a psychological evaluation. Individuals who have been committed involuntarily to a mental health institution at any time; those who have been voluntarily committed with the past 5 years; anyone with a domestic violence restraining order, regardless of criminal history; and anyone who has been placed on the no-fly list or terrorist watch list at any time within the past 10 years will not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms.\n\nPresident Obama was unapologetic in his speech regarding the Executive Order.\n\n“If we are to truly change things for the better, we must come to grips with the ugly truth that our culture is obsessed with violence in all forms. We must work to quell the rising tide of anti-intellectualism and recommit to educating people of all ages so that they are capable of expressing their thoughts and feelings like civilized adults and not like hapless barbarians. Reforming our gun laws is not a magic bullet, and yes, people will find other ways to kill each other, but by making these killing machines harder to get we can hopefully, at the very least, make it so that not as many people fall victim to these random, senseless acts of deplorable violence. I don’t want to take your guns away. I just want to make it harder for the Omar Mateens of the world to kill innocent people. I think we can all agree that if you’re deemed too much of a national security threat to fly on an airplane, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15. Unfortunately, the Republicans didn’t feel this way, and they’ve left me with no other choice. If things don’t change, and people keep dying as a result of senseless acts of gun violence,  I’ll have no choice but to order Homeland Security to hunt down every last assault rifle in this country.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with the new gun law.\n\n\n\n\n \n“These are common sense gun laws and Republicans are using the Second Amendment as a shield that continues to let innocent people die,” Bradley said. “Obama is not tryin’ to take errr guns, he’s doing something that should’ve been done a long time ago. If this law would have been in place before, this Orlando shooting would have never happened. This horrible tragedy was about lack of gun control and had nothing to do with terrorism. Omar Mateen had no communication with ISIS and knew very little about them. As more news comes out about the shooter, we are learning he was a closeted homosexual, and because of his religion, he knew this was not allowed. He hated the fact that he was gay and instead of dealing with it like a man, by getting counseling or leaving Islam, he took his problems out violently on others.” Bradley continued, “I also just want to quickly say ‘thank you’ to everyone that has donated to our cause! The smiles you are putting on homeless peoples’ faces is indescribably. A lot of people don’t know this fact, but socks are the least donated item at shelters but most desired. Please keep the donations coming regardless if it is $5 or $500, every bit helps so much!”\n\nA group of Donald Trump supporters, known as Bullets First, is planning to protest the signing of the Executive Order by marching on Capitol Hill, and in front of the White House, armed with the controversial AR-15, as well as other military style weapons. The group says that it is prepared to “defend the constitution at all costs.” The group is calling for Obama to resign and allow the organization to place him under citizen’s arrest for treason. The group’s leader, 52-year-old Tom Downey, who has two children and another on the way, quit his job as an overnight cashier at the TA truck stop in Sayre, Oklahoma to organize the rally. Downey claims that he has over 100,000 Trump supporters from all over America ready to head to D.C. and “take back the country.” His common law wife, 23-year-old Tami Hobart, supports his decision wholeheartedly, and while she worries about him getting killed, says that at least she can tell her children that he died standing up for their right to stockpile military grade weapons without “getting hassled by an out of control Islamo-communist fascist dictatorship.”\n\nThe group has the backing of right wing shock jock Alex Jones who called on his listeners to “bring about the final solution to the Obama question” on his radio show this morning and pledged financial and logistical support to the Bullets First protestors. Given this development, it is very likely that the group will not be able to be contained by the Washington D.C. police department alone. ABC News says the Pentagon has confirmed that the government is preparing for a “possible military confrontation”, though they stressed that this was a “worst case scenario”.\n\nDespite the heated emotions over this Executive Order, it is not likely to impact the lives of current gun owners in any meaningful way. Elroy Stevens, an avid deer hunter who spends his weekends out in the woods hunting with friends or shooting clay pigeons at his Father-in-law’s ranch in West Texas told ABC News he is not worried about the new gun law.\n\n“It won’t stop someone from being able to buy a handgun for self-defense,” Stevens said. “It does nothing to address individual states’ concealed and open carry laws, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual may own. It does not require the surrender of existing assault weapons, though it does ban all future transfers. This new law makes a minimal effort to keep guns out of the wrong hands.”\n\nAs Obama addressed the crowd, the President told reporters that the country needs more than just common sense gun laws.\n\n“These new gun laws alone will not fix this problem. There are already numerous guns in circulation, and, moreover, the real issue isn’t a gun issue; it is a culture issue. Americans crave television programs that romanticize and fetishize violence. Ignorance is celebrated, while intellectualism is mocked relentlessly. For many gun owners, guns are a tool that must respected and handled with care; for many others, guns are nothing more than an expensive toy. Folks, when this utter disregard for the destructive power of guns is mixed with easy access and a culture that devalues human life, it is a recipe not only for disaster, but for absolute ruin.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n\n\n\n \n“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100\% fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money,” Mikkelson laughs. “And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are 100\% proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts; it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as ‘a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark-protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false “news” stories‘. The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don’t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims; It’s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? To be honest, I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.”\n\nWashington political analyst, 37-year-old Paul Horner, who has been in the hospital since early last month after getting into an accident while in Puerto Peñasco, Mexico, told ABC News what led up to this assault gun ban on both sides of the party.\n\n“Republicans are saying the Orlando shooting is about terrorism because the shooter said he did it for ISIS, even though ISIS did not instruct him to do it and never once had any communication with him. Democrats believe that if we had common sense gun laws in place this tragedy would never occurred. They believe that people like Omar Mateen, who was on a terror watch list and had been interviewed by the FBI three times, should not be allowed to buy assault weapons. And with all of this going on, I’m just laid up in a hospital bed not able to masturbate.”\n\nFappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters he does not agree with Mr. Horner’s comments about touching himself in a hospital bed.\n\n“I think it is great that Paul Horner is not able to pleasure himself right now. He should be focusing on healing and not playing with his sin stick. I have activated my prayer app and I encourage everyone to prayer for Mr. Horner during these difficult times; Not a full-prayer though, just a half prayer.”\n\nExecutive Order 17103 goes into effect July 1st, 2016. The Obama Administration has setup a hotline for individuals to report those who are not abiding by the new law. To encourage the public’s help in cracking down on those who are not following the law, a $500 reward is being offered. The administration urges you to call (785) 273-0325 with any information that you may have, and as always, you can remain anonymous.',fake
'Changing the Way the World Connects\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/changing-way-world-connects/\nThe internet is something of an unusual phenomenon. Throughout human history, advancements were made at quite a steady pace. The agricultural revolution, which saw human beings go from nomadic tribes to stationary creatures capable of farming, took thousands of years. The industrial revolution, which transformed the landscape of how people traveled and created goods, lasted a handful of decades and the changes took place over this entire timeline. Now, in the age of the internet, the world seems to change at a rapid, almost erratic, pace with no signs of stopping.\n\nDue to the advent of the internet, the world has become quite small. It is easy to connect to someone on the other side of the planet in mere seconds. Still, all internet is not treated equally around the world and many are working to make a change in the way that specific countries are connecting.\n\nA Fall and a Rise\nAfghan American entrepreneur Ehsan Bayat is a figure that took a look at the landscape of the world and decided to change it for the better. After the fall of the Taliban in his home country, he realized that there was a vacuum in connectivity. While other nations used the internet freely, most citizens of Afghanistan were still relying on home telephones to communicate with one another, and there were not even enough phone lines in the nation to support the entirety of the population.\n\nDeciding that someone had to do something about this disparity, Bayat set out to create Telephone Systems International. Not only is TSI the largest mobile phone company to be found in his homeland, it also has the honor of being the first of its kind in Afghanistan. This move allowed people in Afghanistan to connect in a way that they never had before, opening new doors of thought and awareness on the world as a whole. Bayat’s work also earned him many humanitarian awards and honors from the global community.\n\nLimited Exposure\nFor a large portion of the world, connecting to the internet is simple. Most people own a smartphone, and can access any information that they need with the quick tap of a screen. Still, there is a significant number of countries where smartphones are rare. In a country such as Lebanon, for example, it is not uncommon for a specific part of the population to rely on the internet via their smartphones. Though there are not many, there still are a significant number when compared to other nations.\n\nOn the other hand, countries like Tunisia or the Philippines have statistics that state that citizens are less likely to have smartphones but still rely on their cellphones throughout the day. Though the people of these nations might not be refreshing their Facebook all day long or stalking their friends’ lunches on Instagram, they still utilize their phones each day for texting and sending pictures. While financial imbalances in these countries might be a large reason for a lack of advanced technology, the desire and the need for internet access are consistently present.\n\nSatellite Transmissions\nWhile it might seem impossible to boost all of these nations into the modern era, there is a lot of work being done to help where it is possible. World Vision International, for example, is a charity that provides humanitarian support to those in need. Often, the workers from this group who enter nations without proper internet access have a difficult time connecting with others back home. This, in turn, makes it difficult for the organization to know exactly what is going on with their volunteers and employees at all times.\n\nTo rectify this, World Vision International has begun putting a plan into action that might be able to help the situation. Utilizing satellite technology, the group has found a way to keep in touch with humanitarians where there is no easy access to data transmission. Essentially, transmitters are placed in a spot where the individual will be working, which communicate with a specific satellite in orbit, in order to send and receive information. This technology helps immensely, as it allows the organization to stay connected to workers in the field, and it opens up the doors for untold possibilities in the future.\n\nMaking Moves\nOther groups are trying to improve access to the internet across the world in many different ways. A Human Right is an organization dedicated to making the world a more connected place. Their mission is simple: every human has the right to access the internet. The group is more than a clever mantra, and they have tirelessly worked to make changes happen in recent years.\n\nFor many years, there has been a plan in the works to lay down a fiber optic cable that linked South Africa to Brazil. Referred to as the South Atlantic Express, this cable caught the attention of A Human Right. The organization noticed that the cable was bypassing the island of Saint Helena, denying convenient internet access to thousands. After much petitioning, the group was able to have the cable rerouted, creating a planned landing station on the small island. Now, when the cable begins connecting people in 2017, Saint Helena will be among the many who have easy internet access.\n\nThere are plenty of ways that people and organizations are trying to connect the world. From Ehsan Bayat to A Human Right, these pioneers are responsible for transforming the landscape and making the world a more equal place for all.',fake
'Actor Bill Murray Announces 2016 Presidential Run\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/actor-bill-murray-announces-2016-presidential-run/\nCharleston, SC — From his home in Charleston, South Carolina, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, 65-year-old Bill Murray, shocked the country today by announcing that he will be running for President in 2016.\n“I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while now, and you know, it just seems right,” Murray said. “I don’t like most of the candidates that are currently running for President. I mean, Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em’, are pretty much complete scum in my opinion.” Murray continued, “I’m always traveling around the world, but I’m proud to call America, the good ole’ U.S. of A, my home. I think there’s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there’s also a lot of confusion and hate. People don’t know what to make of these Hitler wanna-be’s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz’s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it’s sad that people go along with it, and can’t see it for what it really is. I think the American people are better than that and they deserve better. I just feel if I didn’t step up and at least try and do something, I don’t know if I could sleep at night. Well, I would eventually fall asleep, I’m not an insomniac or anything. But it would keep me up, that’s for sure. Look, I’m no hero, I just want to help out, and I think I can do that by being President.” Murray finished by saying, “So I’m making it official, right here, right now; I Bill Murray am running for President of the United States in 2016.”\n\n\n\n\n \nWhen reporters asked Murray his plans on improving America, Murray said, “I think we ought to be personally responsible. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that’s sort of how you’re supposed to live. I think we’ve sort of gotten used to someone looking out for us, and I don’t think any other person is necessarily going to be counted on to look out for us.”\n\nSo far it is unclear what political party Murray will be joining.\n\nIn 2012, Murray met Obama purely by chance at a basketball game – Murray never endorsed him. In fact, when asked about the Obama/Romney race happening that year, Murray said there really was not much difference between them.\n\n“You know they both talk, they’re not so different really, you know if you shake them out, they’re not so different as people in what they say they believe it’s just whether or not they can get it done, and that requires finding that stuff, that real stuff, finding that presence of mind and spirit.”\n\nWhen asked about his religious views, Murray told reporters, “Religion is the worst enemy of mankind. People can believe whatever they choose to believe, but it does not belong in politics. It imprisons your mind. Religion creates hate, racism, bigotry and keeps you from your true potential in life. No single war in the history of humanity has killed as many people as religion has. I imagine I probably won’t be too popular with the Christian vote in this country, but I’m fine with that,” Murray laughs.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President.\n\n“We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can’t be bought,” Bradley said. “I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing; he’s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place.”\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesman for the campaign, told reporters that he believes in Bill Murray for President in 2016.\n\n“We need a man like Bill Murray now more than ever. He is a man of the people. He’s charming, charismatic, intelligent, humble, caring and most of all, he’s honest. He has no scandals. He’s told no lies. The people love him and respect him, they believe in him. He’s a living legend and is exactly what America needs right now.”\n\nMurray’s campaign team told reporters they will begin campaigning at the Arizona State Capitol on Wednesday, The Lost Leaf at 10PM on Thursday for their monthly Mystery Show to talk to the locals and maybe tell some jokes, and then all throughout Denver, Colorado on Friday.\n',fake
'It?s been a whirlwind few days of bombshells and videos that have to be seen to be believed. ?The level of corruption and collusion exposed by both the Wikileaks releases of John Podesta?s emails, and the Project Vertias undercover videos of Democratic operatives charged with carrying out voter fraud and election rigging is astounding. ?Word now comes that one of the people caught on tape, Robert Creamer, founder of Democracy Partners, one of the entities inciting violence, voter fraud, and more, visited the White House 340 times in the Obama years, with 45 meetings where Barack Obama was present.At the time of this writing, Creamer has decided to ?step back? from participating in Democracy Partners activities. ?Current Democratic National Committee Chairperson Donna Brazile claims that Creamer and his people were but bit players in the campaign process. ?Creamer?s own words, and James O?Keefe?s investigative reporting with Project Veritas refutes that.In one hidden camera video, filmed at Creamer?s Washington, D.C. office, Creamer explains that Hillary Clinton is aware of ?all? of his activities, directly or indirectly, and that Democracy Partners has a daily conference call with the Clinton campaign, as well as frequent calls with the White House.According to the White House visitor logs, Creamer actually met with Barack Obama privately twice, in 2011 and 2013. ?What was discussed in those sessions is anyone?s guess.Creamer is the second of the Democratic operatives to be removed from campaign activities since the Project Veritas videos were released. ?The first was Scott Foval. ?He was fired from Americans United for Change on Tuesday after his appearance in the video, and his stated admiration for Creamer, and his diabolical ideas. ?Foval described the efforts as being ?black hat.?Statements published by Democracy Partners and the DNC discuss well-funded smear campaigns similar to the Watergate effort that eventually brought down the presidency of Richard Nixon who was accused of doing far less than Hillary Clinton is known to have done in the felony department.BREAKING News: Bob Creamer, top @HillaryClinton campaign advisor, \"STEPS DOWN\" after today\'s video.

'Ted Cruz: “I Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal”\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/ted-cruz-to-endorse-trump-for-president-masturbation-illegal/\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’.\n\n\n\n\n \n“Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. I’m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil’s playground for good,” Cruz said. “I’m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it’s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.”\n\nDonald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.\n\n“Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t. To be honest, I don’t know a lot about this subject matter. I don’t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and she’s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “Right to stimulate one’s genitals.” Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “A new belief of his”, implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story.\n\n“All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldn’t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. It’s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one’s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can’t do it anymore, then no one can.”\n\n\n\n\n \nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party.\n\n“It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President,” Bradley said. “With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.” Bradley continued, “Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.”\n\nCruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. “When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, they’re big enough to handle it.”\n\nMost pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43\% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46\% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11\% of Trump supporters are against a ban.\n\nRNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a “no-brainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.\n\n“Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous.

'Facebook Buys Snapchat For Five Billion Dollars\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/facebook-buys-snapchat-five-billion-dollars/\nMENLO PARK, C.A. (AP) — Facebook announced this morning that it has purchased mobile photo sharing app Snapchat for the price of five billion dollars. The social media titan had previously tried to purchase Snapchat for three billion in 2013, but Snapchat’s CEO Evan Spiegel rejected the offer, citing his desire to continue growing the company instead of settling for a short term gain.\n\n“This is a bittersweet moment for us here,” Spiegel said in a press conference. “It’s sad to let go of something that we’ve put so much time and hard work in, but  we’ve already accomplished so much more than we ever dreamed possible. I feel much better about this than I did in 2013.”\n\nIn an official statement, Facebook said that it intends to phase out the Snapchat app and assimilate the technology into its existing Instagram platform.\n\n\n\n\n \n“For the first year, the two apps will exist side by side with Instagram slowly adding more of Snapchat’s features,” said Facebook spokesman Arthur Mitchum, “But eventually Snapchat will cease to exist altogether. Once Snapchat’s technology has been fully integrated into Instagram, it will be pointless for us to continue maintaining two separate platforms.”\n\nIn order to sell users on the change, Facebook is planning a multi-million dollar ad campaign featuring Big Bang Theory actress Kelly Cuoco and Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence. Facebook also indicated that the campaign will feature a male celebrity, whom they have yet to name. According to TMZ, the frontrunners are pop star Justin Bieber and Adam Levine from Maroon 5 and NBC’s “The Voice”.\n\nFacebook buys Snapchat\nReaction to the deal has been mixed thus far, with many excited to see how Facebook will integrate Snapchat with its Instagram app. Others are angry that Facebook plans to shutter Snapchat in favor of Instagram. Twitter user @salteepeanuts tweeted that “Mark Zuckerburg won’t stop until he’s ruined everything good about the internet.”\n\nDr. Cassandra Schmidt of the Center for Integrity in Media has serious concerns about the implications of the deal.\n\n“It’s always troubling when you see this kind of media consolidation,” Dr. Schmidt told ABC news. “We currently have a situation where 6 companies control 90\% of traditional media sources. The internet was supposed to change this and give more power to the little guy, but we are still seeing the same tendency toward consolidation. Those Snapchat users who don’t like Facebook will be left with few, if any, alternatives.”\n\nThe deal has already generated a tremendous amount of buzz on Wall Street. Facebook’s stock is up 20\% this morning, but some investors are taking more of a wait and see approach.\n\n“A deal of this scope is really unprecedented in the social media world,” said Lawrence Ketchum, who writes about the tech industry for Forbes. “It could be a real game changer and turn the entire internet on its head; then again, it could be a real dud and turn into a huge liability for Facebook. Investors will be watching this deal very closely to see how it affects the social media landscape.”\n\nIf you want to learn more about this deal and what it means for you as a consumer, you can call Facebook’s public relations hotline at (202) 642-5720.',fake
'Ted Cruz Will Endorse Donald Trump For President If He Makes Masturbation Illegal\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/ted-cruz-to-endorse-donald-trump-for-president/\nWASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’.\n\n\n\n\n \n“Self-love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you’ve died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. I’m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key; what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil’s playground for good,” Cruz said. “I’m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it’s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table.”\n\nDonald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue.\n\n“Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t. To be honest, I don’t know a lot about this subject matter. I don’t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and she’s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non-reproductive purposes illegal.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self-stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in 2007 he fought to uphold the state’s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no “Right to stimulate one’s genitals.” Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re-surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz’s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz’s stance against stimulating one’s own genitals was “A new belief of his”, implying that much of Cruz’s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz’s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin’s story.\n\n“All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldn’t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. It’s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one’s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can’t do it anymore, then no one can.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by Ted Cruz.\n\n\n\n\n \n“It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nominee for President,” Bradley said. “With all of the real problems in this country such as children going to bed hungry, families worrying about having a roof over their head, so many people out of work; here is Ted Cruz, focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime.” Bradley continued, “Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.”\n\nCruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. “When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil’s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands; hopefully, they’re big enough to handle it.”\n\nMost pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz’s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that 43\% of likely Trump voters support a ban on self-stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another 46\% would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only 11\% of Trump supporters are against a ban.\n\nRNC political strategist, 37-year-old Paul Horner, calls the move a “no-brainer” and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz.\n\n“This is a stroke of genius! Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party’s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is.”\n\nRegardless of which side Trump takes on the issue, it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle.

'Drug Kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman Escapes Mexican Prison For The Third Time\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News \nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/drug-kingpin-el-chapo-escapes-mexican-prison-once-again/\nMEXICO CITY, MEXICO (AP) — Early this morning, drug kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, escaped from the Altiplano maximum security prison once again.\nIt is unclear at this point what exactly happened, but these are the details ABC News has received from Mexican officials so far:\n\nAs you can see this drug is similar to adderall and how adderall works when you can buy adderall online as explained in http://www.buyadderallxr247.com/.\n\n5:35 AM: Guzmán was taken in restraints by two prison guards on a routine cell transfer.\n\n6:05 AM: Prison staff could not locate Guzmán or the two prison guards’s whereabouts. The prison was put on lockdown as personnel went looking for them.\n\n7:15 AM: A prison van was found abandoned only a mile away from the prison. Mexican officials believe the two guards, who began working at the prison just months ago, were actually members of the Sinaloa Cartel working for Guzmán.\n\n\n\n\n \nBefore today’s escape, Mexican officials were working to extradite “El Chapo” to the United States, where he faced drug trafficking charges connected to his cartel, authorities said.\n\nThis is now the third time Guzmán has escaped from a Mexican prison and brings into question Mexico’s ability to keep corruption out of it’s penal system.\n\nIn 1993, Guzmán was captured in Guatemala, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. In 2001, after bribing Mexican prison guards, he was able to escape from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. On February 22nd, 2014, Guzmán was found inside his fourth-floor condominium in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and was captured without any gunshots being fired. Guzmán escaped from prison again on July 11th, 2015 by exiting through a tunnel that led to a nearby construction site. He was recaptured by Mexican marines following a shootout at Guzman’s hideout in Mexico on January 8th, 2016. During the raid, five gunmen were killed, six others arrested, and one Marine was wounded. The Mexican Navy said that they found two armored cars, eight assault rifles, including two Barrett M82 sniper rifles, two M16 rifles with grenade launchers and a loaded rocket-propelled grenade launcher. A .50-caliber rifle was also found, capable of taking down a helicopter. Most of the weapons seized, including the .50 caliber rifle, were from the Fast and Furious gun-smuggling scandal, a story the U.S. government declared to be over.\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the United State’s drug policies.\n\n“The war on drugs is a joke and long-lost battle,” Bradley said. “The U.S. creates these cartels by making drugs illegal in the first place. They lock up people in jail for as little as a joint of marijuana. All the incarcerations related to drugs have helped fund a trillion-dollar penal system; from its lawyers, to judges, to the prison staff and the actual prisons themselves. All of it is just pathetic and truly a sad reality.” Bradley continued, “Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps.”\n\n\n\n\n \nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.\n\n“You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy,” Mikkleson said. “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax-exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.” Mikkelson continues, “It is common for us to rewrite a story we’re debunking if we don’t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person’s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un-funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is 100\% fabricated.

It was time for him to move on. So brave! Praise El Chapo!”\n\nAfter news of the escape, Paul Horner, a U.S. Marshal, working along with Mexican officials, spoke to local law enforcement.\n\n“Listen up, ladies and gentlemen. Our fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground, barring injuries, is 4 miles-an-hour. That gives us a radius of six miles. What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard-target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse in that area. Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles. Your fugitive’s name is Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman. Go get him.”\n\nU.S. Officials along with Mexican authorities have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325 for anyone with information about the whereabouts of Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman.

'The Amish In America Commit Their Vote To Donald Trump; Mathematically Guaranteeing Him A Presidential Victory\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/amish-america-commit-vote-donald-trump-mathematically-guaranteeing-presidential-victory/\nUPDATE: THIS WORKED, GIVING DONALD TRUMP THE PRESIDENCY\n\nCOLUMBUS, OH (AP) — History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November.\n\n\n\n\n \nThe organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee.\n\nThe Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don’t vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process.\n\n“Over the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,” said AAB Chairman Elijah Fisher. “We have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage allowing the homogays to come together just like normal people. And now, they want to put a woman in the nation’s highest leadership role in direct violation of my favorite Bible passage, 1 Timothy 2:12, ‘I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet’.” Fisher continued, “We need to stop this assault on God and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord’s way.”\n\nAccording to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote.\n\n“The Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,” Silver noted. “They also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.”\n\n37-year-old Paul Horner, a self-proclaimed “Donald Trump supporter since day one” told Leilani Hernandez, a reporter with local Columbus news station WBNS-10TV he is thrilled that Trump will be the next President.\n\n“This is such great news, a Trump victory, I knew it would happen, I have been praying for it night and day,” Horner said. “Plus I work November 8th and it was going to be tough for me to get off work and vote because my boss is not the nicest of people. But now thanks to the great Amish people of this country, they have this thing locked up for a Donald Trump victory against crooked Hillary and I won’t have to miss work! God is good!”\n\nThe Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision.\n\n\n\n\n \n“I don’t believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,” Clinton wrote to the AAB. “As a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.”\n\nMost pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton’s plea is too little too late.\n\nDuring a press conference in Manhattan early this morning, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because “the Amish do great work, the best work, for a very low price.”\n\nThough Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50\% of its staff within the next week. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses.\n\n“It looked like she was going to win this election easily,” said Tom Downey, a campaign manager in Ohio, “But this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It’s really sad to see the campaign end this way.”\n\nThe AAB chooses weekly charities for those wishing to support what they do. The AAB’s charity for the week of November 4th is Sock It Forward, a charity that provides the homeless with brand new socks.

'NBA Cancels 2017 All-Star Game In North Carolina Over Anti-LGBT Law\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/nba-cancels-all-star-game-in-north-carolina-lgbt-hb2/\nCharlotte, NC — NBA Commissioner Adam Silver held a press conference today, announcing that Charlotte, North Carolina will no longer be hosting the 2017 All-Star game due to the state’s recent passing of the anti-LGBT law HB2.\n\n“With this new law in place, Charlotte currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that would be vital for a large event such as the All-Star Game,” Silver told reporters. “We are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the 2017 All-Star game to be held elsewhere. I want to make it clear that the NBA will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.”\n\nSilver’s comments come just weeks after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, which requires transgender people (and everyone else) to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate. The new law also strips North Carolina workers of the ability to sue under a state anti-discrimination law, a right that has been upheld in court since 1985.\n\n“If you were fired because of your race, fired because of your gender, fired because of your religion,” said Allan Freyer, head of the Workers’ Rights Project at the North Carolina Justice Center in Raleigh, “You no longer have a basic remedy.”\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 100 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. In addition to that, by not hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star game, the state stands to lose even more. It is uncertain the exact figure, but in 2014, the All-Star game in New Orleans generated $106.1 Million and in 2015, New York generated approximately $195 million in economic activity.\n\nOn Friday, Bruce Springsteen cancelled his concert in Greensboro because of North Carolina’s controversial new LGBT bill stating, “With deepest apologies to our dedicated fans in Greensboro, we have canceled our show scheduled for Sunday, April 10th. Some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry — which is happening as I write — is one of them. It is the strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.”\n\nEarlier this week, a women’s advocacy group, UltraViolet, began circulating an online petition urging Nike and PepsiCo — two chief sponsors of previous NBA All-Star weekends — to not support the 2017 event if it is held in Charlotte. There is also a new campaign in North Carolina encouraging people to call McCrory’s office every time they use a public restroom to report on their compliance with the law.\n\nNorth Carolina has become a fierce battleground for culture war issues. Since the GOP captured the legislature in 2010 and the governorship in 2012, there’s been a steady stream of conservative changes, from much stricter voter laws to looser gun laws to overhauling taxes. The legislature even considered a proposal to establish Christianity as the official state religion.\n\nMarina Mangiaracina, a transgender individual, who is a journalist for SB Nation, does not agree with the new law.\n\n“First of all, no one carries around their birth certificate. How is a cop going to check what gender a person has on that document? Second of all, the policy of refusing to change the gender on your birth certificate until you have sex reassignment surgery is dangerous. Not all trans people need, want, or can afford sexual reassignment surgery. It’s an extremely delicate and risky procedure that costs anywhere from $7,000 to $50,000. Not to mention all of the missed work in the weeks of recovery. Forcing, or even encouraging transgendered people to have that surgery is sickening. If the person wants the surgery, that’s one thing. But not everybody can afford that surgery. It simply discriminates against the poor.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that the new law needs to be repealed.\n\n“This is a ridiculous law that makes absolutely no sense,” Bradley said. “According to the law, a transgender man, a person with a vagina but has male features, such as a beard, now has to go into the women’s bathroom. Then the police get called. How exactly do they verify what’s going on there? Does the transgender man have to drop his pants or is that person required to be carrying their birth certificate at all times? And according to the idiots behind this law, it’s about stopping sexual predators. How? Is it really that hard for a man to put on a wig and a Hillary suit and go into the women’s restroom? No. This law is about bigotry, hate, intolerance and taking away human rights from the LGBT community.”\n\nDavid Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, told ABC News that his wife Barbara is transgender.\n\n“Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the surgery my wife Barbara wanted; her name actually used to be Ted,” Mikkleson laughs, “We claim ‘to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well‘, but that’s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that’s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I’m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, look at this article we wrote about Scientology supposedly losing its tax-exempt status. What is the name of the person or website responsible for the hoax? We claim to know it, since we list the website’s disclaimer; but no real information is there. We even go as far as saying the site that started the story spreads malware and viruses, but we don’t say what website it is. I think warning people about a website that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but that’s a lot of work and people will click our ads regardless, bottom line; so why do the extra work? And lots of people complain, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours.” Mikkelson breaks down in tears, “Anyway, about my transgender wife Barbara; so brave.”\n\nPaul Horner, owner of the Phoenix Suns, told ABC News he approves of the NBA’s decision but believes more should be done.\n\n“I applaud the NBA in taking a stand against this type of discrimination and pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. Furthermore, I believe it’s time for Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan to take a stand against this law and move the team out of that backwards state.”\n\nAt this time, unless the North Carolina legislature repeals HB2, it is unclear where the 2017 All-Star game will be held.',fake

The thank you slide was well made and it was the slide whole media was waiting for as they were too tired of the long presentation. The ?Any Questions?? slide generated least amount of interest as by the time this slide got displayed, 90 \% of the journalists were fast asleep. One thing the finance ministry missed out was the ?urprise test? round where they could have actually asked question to media based on the presentation. This way they could have arrived upon the number of people actually paying attention during the ppt.Arun Jaitley ji has promised that in future also such detailed ppts will be conducted so that people are aware of India?s financial condition and also they know about the way forward. faking News also found some college students downloading the ppt from the finance ministry website and using them directly for their presentations on finance subjects, and well, scoring good marks too.',fake
'North Carolina Governor Sets Up Hotline To Report Anyone Not Using Correct Bathroom\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/nc-governor-hb2-hotline-report-correct-bathroom/\nRaleigh, NC — At a press conference today, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory took further steps to ensure that his controversial bill, HB2, will be upheld when it comes to law enforcement. McCrory announced that his office has setup a 24-hour hotline for individuals to call if they witness someone not abiding by the new law.\n\n“If you see a woman, who doesn’t look like a woman, using the woman’s restroom, be vigilant, call the hotline, and report that individual.” McCrory told reporters. “We need our state to unite as one if we’re going to keep our children safe from all the sexual predators and other aberrant behavior that is out there.”\n\nTom Downey, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office, explained the new hotline to reporters.\n\n“Beginning today, individuals that notice any kind of gender-suspicious activity in the men’s or women’s restrooms are encouraged to call the new ‘HB2 Offender Hotline’,” Horner said. “We encourage North Carolina’s residents to take photographs and report as much detail as possible when calling. With the information gathered from this hotline, we’ll be working closely with local law enforcement agencies to make sure this law is enforced and those who break the law see jail bars. We are sending a clear message to all the transsexuals out there; their illegal actions and deviant behavior will no longer be tolerated in the state of North Carolina.”\n\n“I applaud HB2, the offender hotline they setup and Governor Pat McCrory,” North Carolina resident Steve Jenkins told local news station WTVD. “As a man, how would some women like it if I followed her into the restroom and just told her that everything is OK because I’m transgender? She wouldn’t like it at all, and that’s why you need a law like HB2.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News HB2 and the new hotline make no sense.\n\n“In the history of North Carolina, not one sexually related criminal act has happened in a bathroom by someone who is transgender. No arrests, no convictions, but they still want to make laws, just in case that “one time” ever happens. It’s like making laws outlawing marijuana in the event that someone actually ever dies from it,” Bradley said. “There were plenty of laws already in place before HB2. It doesn’t matter if you’re a man, woman, transgender, or what bathroom you use; if you’re in there longer than 5 minutes after using the restroom, someone is going to call the cops. This new law is about people living in fear, gathering together around their weird ideologies and religious beliefs to create more intolerance and hate in this world, bottom line.”\n\n“I don’t want my money, my taxes going towards anything that discriminates against anyone, especially in public bathrooms,” said North Carolina resident, Steven Hamilton. “I don’t care what a private individual or business does and how hate-filled they want to be, because I can protest and show as much discontent towards them as I want to, but when it comes to my money, those places better be free for all to use, no matter what sexual identity a person may identify with.” Hamilton continued, “Also, I have an eight-year-old daughter who I don’t like using the restroom by herself. What am I supposed to do now? Take her into the women’s bathroom and hope I don’t get arrested or take her with me into the men’s restroom and hope the cops don’t get called? And what if the cops show up and I don’t have my birth certificate on me? Would I actually go to jail? All of this is completely insane.”\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law last month, well over 1,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 400 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. Entertainers such as Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil have also canceled their performances in North Carolina to boycott the law. Pressure has been put on the NBA to cancel the All-Star game in North Carolina next year, though as of yet, the league is not budging. It is still unclear what kind of an economic impact these boycotts will have on the state’s economy as a whole. NBC estimates that North Carolina has lost $186 million in revenue due to boycotts so far.\n\nTo report suspicious bathroom activity, North Carolina residents can call the ‘HB2 Offender Hotline’ at 1-800-662-7952. For individuals living outside of North Carolina, please call (919) 814-2000. To file a complaint after normal business hours, call (919) 814-2050 and press option 3.',fake
'Michael Jordan To North Carolina: ‘HB2 Goes Or The Charlotte Hornets Go’\nJimmy Rustling, ABC News\nf\nhttp://abcnews.com.co/michael-jordan-hb2-goes-or-the-charlotte-hornets-go/\nCHARLOTTE N.C. (AP) — NBA legend and Charlotte Hornets‘ owner, Michael Jordan, held a press conference today, announcing his intentions to move the Hornets out of North Carolina if the state does not revoke its controversial HB2 law.\n\n“With this new law in place, North Carolina currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that is vital, not just for our fans but for everyone,” Jordan told reporters. “We are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the the Charlotte Hornets to play elsewhere. I want to make it clear that neither the Hornets nor I will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.”\n\nJordan’s comments come after the North Carolina legislature passed HB2 back in March, a law which requires transgender individuals to use public restrooms according to the biological sex on their birth certificate.\n\nPaul Horner, a spokesman for the Charlotte Hornets, told ABC News that the team is currently talking to several cities about a possible relocation if the state decides to keep HB2 intact.\n\n“We are currently in talks with certain individuals in the cities of Austin and Seattle, among others,” Horner said. “We sincerely hope it does not come to moving the team, but in the event North Carolina does not revoke the law, we must be prepared for the worse.”\n\nSarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she agrees with Michael Jordan taking a stand against North Carolina and HB2.\n\n“If anyone can get a bigoted law like HB2 revoked, it’s Michael Jordan,” Bradley said. “There were plenty of laws already in place before HB2. It doesn’t matter if you’re a man, woman, transgender, or what bathroom you use; if you’re in there longer than five minutes after using the restroom, someone is going to call the cops. Creepy men or women doing creepy things in a restroom gets you on a sex offender list and you go to prison for such crimes. In fact, in the history of North Carolina, not one transgender individual has ever been convicted of a sexually related crime in a restroom. This new law is about people living in fear, gathering together around their weird ideologies and religious beliefs to create more intolerance and hate in this world, bottom line. This ridiculous law has also given me insight into the working mind of a far right-wing Republican. Apparently there are serious amounts of orgies and other sexual activities going on in bathrooms that I never knew about.” Bradley laughs, “On a serious note; I sincerely want to thank everyone that has donated socks or money to our cause ‘Sock It Forward’. Socks are the least donated items but the most desired; it helps the homeless so much and your support has put smiles on so many faces. Thank you.”\n\nSince Governor Pat McCrory signed HB2 into law back in March, well over 5,000 jobs have been moved out of state, and over 400 companies, including Facebook, Apple, Paypal, Pyramid Country and StopPack, have expressed concern or anger, warning they may move or cancel plans to expand, costing the state millions of dollars. Entertainers such as Pearl Jam, Ringo Starr, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil have also canceled their performances in North Carolina to boycott the law. Pressure has been put on the NBA to cancel the All-Star game in North Carolina next year and this week NBA Commissioner Adam Silver clarified the league’s willingness to move the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte if North Carolina legislators do not overturn the new state law. It is still unclear what kind of an economic impact these boycotts will have on the state’s economy as a whole. NBC estimates that North Carolina has lost $186 million in revenue due to boycotts so far. ABC News puts that figure well above $300 million.\n\nJordan finished the press conference by reiterating his demands.\n\n“As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment,” Jordan said. “As has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games. If that means moving the team out of the state if North Carolina doesn’t repeal HB2, then that is what we are prepared to do. I urge you all to call Governor Pat McCrory’s Office and voice your concerns. Together we can keep the Hornets in North Carolina!”\n\nNorth Carolina residents can call Gov. Pat McCrory at 1-800-662-7952. For individuals living outside of North Carolina, call (919) 814-2000. After normal business hours, call (919) 814-2050 and press option 3.',fake

Up to yesterday he was denying the rumors. A lot of people were not buying into that.

I’ve had too many people call me and beg me to enter this race.\n\nRomney has been quite outspoken against Donald Trump, and he made a 17-minute speech  calling Trump a “phony” and a “fraud. He recently told The Wall Street Journal that his advisers begged him not to go after Trump, but he did so anyway so that he could “sleep at night.”\n\n“I wanted my grand kids to see that I simply couldn’t ignore what Mr. Trump was saying and doing, which revealed a character and temperament unfit for the leader of the free world,” Romney said.\n\nDonald Trump was anticipating that an announcement was imminent and tweeted this yesterday.\n\nThe early consensus is that this will hurt Donald Trump the most and will pave the way for an easy Hilary Clinton victory in November.',fake
'Bengaluru: It has been two days, Prakash is unable to come to terms not because he met with an accident. His problem is for a change he was following traffic rule for the first time, someone came from behind and hit him on the back side.While speaking to our reporter from hospital bed Prakash with a broken leg & hand under plaster said, ?I do not know what happened to me, I was following traffic rule. Maybe it?s a classic case of brain fade which happened to the likes of Australian captain Steve Smith in the past. Thanks to my connections, a person like me has never bothered about following rules even when traffic cops are around.?Prakash added, ?Sometime back my friends took me to an eye specialist thinking I have some color blindness problem as all signals red, yellow, green looked same to me. Simply because I never looked at signals or on my speedometer. One of my friend says not only when I ?jumped? the signal it was green, I was even under the speed limits. The alcohol readings are also within the limits as I can see from the reports.??For fifteen years, I am driving my bike on these roads. Of course, with a driving license RTO guys delivered at my home, but I did not know what is called Zebra crossing. Other day my niece was asking about it showing me a picture, I told her may be for some decorative purpose traffic cops paint some portion of the road near signals. After her school teacher scolded and told her about it, I came to know about it from her,? said Prakash.Police has traced the culprit behind Prakash?s accident. While speaking to us a traffic constable said, ?Like Prakash, the person who hit him was following traffic rule for the first time. We cannot arrest him, as he has also connections at the top. With so much risk for people following rules, traffic police is going to put a disclaimer at all major signals, Follow traffic rules at your own risk.?',fake
'A few weeks ago, on August 21st, Retired Admiral Ace Lyons, former Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, addressed a gathering of Republicans at the Luxe Hotel in Los Angeles. He began by asking his audience, ?Are you ready to take back America?? Following their affirmative response, Admiral Lyons says, ?Your presence here says it all. You understand we have not only a constitutional crisis but a national security crisis.?Lyons asks what our conservative leadership has done, saying, ?Our conservative leadership has failed to understand they were given control of Congress to stop the fundamental transformation of America, not to facilitate it. And then, what did they do? They funded all of ?president? Obama?s illegal programs. While at the same time ignoring his over fourteen impeachable offenses. This is unconscionable. So, where do we go from there??Admiral Lyons said, ?You know we have, as ?president? Obama has said, he wants to fundamentally transform America. Well what is it? Well let me tell you. It?s un-American, it?s anti-Western, but pro-Islam, pro-Iranian, and pro-Muslim Brotherhood. You have to ask yourself, why would an American ?president? embrace the Muslim Brotherhood, whose creed is to destroy us from within, with our own miserable hand, and replace our Constitution with Draconian Sharia Law??Lyons continues, ?Now you understand we have a serious national security crisis. When you have a ?president,? who is not interested in America leading, or America winning, then you know the greatest threat to our national security resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. We have a ?president? who refuses to identify the enemy. It was Erdogan, when he was prime minister of Turkey who said it best. ?Islam is Islam. There are no modifiers. Democracy is the train we ride to our ultimate objective, which is to make Islam dominant throughout the world.? He couldn?t have said it any plainer.??Islam is a totalitarian ideology,? says Lyons, ?bent on world domination, masquerading as a religion.? He goes on to explain he rejects the term ?radical Islam,? saying, ?That implies there?s some moderate Islam. There ain?t any and you all know it but you?ve got to get the word out.? Admiral Lyons points to the failure of leadership among the West as well as Pope Francis in refusing to support Egypt?s president el-Sisi. He also mentions the insanely destructive Muslim outreach program of Pope Frank and his declarations that Islam is a religion of peace, saying, ?This is non-sense.?He goes on to describe how Obama and the globalists are following the exact prescription for the destruction of a nation here in the United States, beginning with the destruction of our military, including sequestration and social engineering of the military by civilians who are themselves not worthy for military service. He addresses the mental disorder of transgender individuals who are now being embraced by the military leadership.He addresses the agreement that isn?t an agreement, the Iranian nuke deal which has never been signed. Obama gave them the money anyway, whatever his true motivations were. He notes that John Kerry gave up more than our objectives in his kabuki dance negotiations, ?he gave up our honor. He gave away everything that we sought to obtain, and then to keep the Iranians at the table, we had to invent new concessions.? Lyons goes on to talk a little bit about the Iranians.He describes how Obama?s treason against the United States began even before he was ?elected,? that he sent word to the Iranians urging them to not make any deals with the Bush administration because Obama was their friend and he?d make a better deal. That?s possibly the only time Obama has told the truth in 8 years.While Admiral Lyons believes that the actions of Obama with the Iranians bordered on treason, he says there is no doubt with Libya and Benghazi and the ?pathological liar? Hillary Clinton. He says if you take nothing else away, understand that in Libya America ?switched sides in the global war on terror. They knew they were funding al-Qaeda militias, the Muslim Brotherhood controlled militias and those rebels in Syria who morphed into ISIS. They provided them training, funding and weapons, there?s no question about it.?He points to the many shortcomings and failures of Clinton in Libya and Benghazi, many of them due to reckless disregard and cautions his audience, and all of us, that the ?pathological liar who couldn?t handle the security of a pissant 13 acre compound in Benghazi and you now want to turn over the security of this great country to her?

'Trump supporters have allowed a false narrative to creep into the election and take on the acceptance, stature and significance of a fact. It?s a dangerous argument that has fundamentally weakened our position and our candidate. That argument is one heard far and wide, that this race has two deeply flawed candidates. Americans need to listen to what they?re saying, analyze and recognize it for the nonsensical political babble that it is.It?s a half truth. There is one highly flawed person in the two person race, a criminal that has sold out her nation and continues to do so even during the heat of the battle for the presidency. There is one habitual liar who has admitted that she has a public position and a private position on even the most important issues, who serves at the pleasure?the globalists who finance not only her campaign but every other aspect her miserable, corrupt existence, doing their bidding in destroying the United States in every manner imaginable.There is one candidate who does not give a damn about the Constitution, our bill of rights, our sovereignty or the rule of law. She is on the record as having stating her willingness and desire to flood this nation with foreigners of every description, legalizing all those who have violated our immigration laws within the first one hundred days and drastically increasing the number of Islamic terrorists that she allows into the United States. She will do so while endangering the lives of innocent Americans in the process, as a paid harlot of the America-haters, with no idea or concern of the type of individual she is bringing in or how many Americans will die as a result. The Marxist agenda and her fascist cronies will be served, not the American people.That is the terribly flawed candidate, Hillary Clinton. A criminal, a lifelong Marxist who has a history of intimate association with the communist party, a pathological liar who hates America, who will accelerate the Obama agenda of fundamental transformation to the point America is completely unrecognizable.Contrasted against that defective subhuman mongrel we are fortunate to have chosen an America-loving patriot as her opponent, Donald Trump. He?s a man who doesn?t lie to us and is criticized by the deceivers for his honesty and straight talk. He?s a man who is fighting a battle that no other candidate in the history of this nation has had to fight. Trump stands alone against the fascists, the globalists, the establishment, the academics, the Marxists, the foreigners, the terrorist sympathizers, the profiteers, the faux environmentalists, the Democrats, the social program parasites, the media whores and every other group that feeds off of the destruction and pillaging of the United States.We have a rare man in Donald Trump who has the strength of character and the will to stand up to this onslaught. He?s a man running for the right reasons, in service to his country and his fellow American, running for its survival in the face of tremendous odds. Trump is giving of himself and sacrificing himself so that his children and ours might have a future in the land that we all love, recognizing that it is in real peril and if this election is lost to the globalists so is this nation.Mr. Trump suffers personal ridicule and character assassination on our behalf that would cause lesser men to throw up their hands and walk away. He?s getting minimal support from the familiar establishment Judases who claim to be on his side, those who adorn themselves with a false mantle of conservatism as a means of deception. They are faces and names that are familiar, the traitors to this nation and the GOP, mouse-men like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Mitt Romney and any Bush.A lesser man would have given up by now, and God knows we?ve got a federal government full of lesser-thans of that caliber for reference. Yet Donald Trump goes on, doggedly, unshakable in his determination to do what is right for this nation, to be the man that saves America at its most vulnerable moment.We are fortunate to have an exceptional candidate in Donald Trump; the best and only man who could and would truly represent us rather than merely provide lip service as he slides the knife into our backs. We cannot survive more of that establishment type of turncoat that now fills Congress, the executive branch and the judiciary. They are the familiar serpents that cannot be trusted and who cannot tell the truth, who have brought our nation to the brink of destruction; the type of evil personified by Hillary Clinton.?This is not an election with two flawed candidates. This is an election with the worst of all candidates, one of the worst subhumans ever to draw a breath, facing off against a man of the caliber of a founding father, another Washington, Jefferson, Jackson or Reagan. We need to stop accepting the false proclamations of the lying media, stop allowing them to define the race in terms that suit their efforts to hide their candidate?s many flaws and our candidate?s extreme greatness.Donald Trump is the best of all candidates. He defeated 16 others who were all better choices than the woman he faces now. He is precisely the man America needs and we Americans need to become vocal in making that desperate need and our unwavering support known to everyone. We must recognize our good fortune and understand that the perfect candidate for the times is still not going to be a perfect man. There is no such thing. Finding the perfect leader to rescue us and our nation from certain destruction is all we can or should ask. The presidency is the toughest job in government. While Trump isn?t perfect, he?s close. As they say, close enough for government work. And much closer than anyone who?s been in there in decades.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake

Their career path lays perfectly laid out in front of them.With so much money involved, it was bound to find some haters (These are the guys who still survive on the credit limit of Rs. 5, hence jealous) who would want to distract them.When they write an article on Modi, Bhakts fill up the comment boxes with abuses.When they write an article on Kejriwal, Aapians tear them apart, without any logic obviously.When they write an article on Congress, Congress?s come back saying facts can?t be presented as satires. Anyways leave them now.Frustrated that they can?t write on anyone famous, the association has decided to lend support to an independent candidate for the next PM elections. The reasons, when inquired about, was straightforward. She is the only one whose supporters even don?t mind for writing articles on her. you can go to any level, she has tolerance more than any politician/actor/industrialist. She should have been the role model for our audience.Its time India takes the next big step and choose Her as the next PM, so that our successful journey continues, and at least one of us can buy Antilla model from Chandni Chowk worth Rs. 100.',fake

'News reports and Tweets from?Qaraqosh, Iraq, the largest Christian city in that country located near Mosul, all say ?liberated,? but the simple truth is that the Islamic State was driven from the city last week by Christian soldiers. ?The terrorist organization is still in the region, and in their wake, they leave behind a mess.This destruction is bad enough, though it is not total. Isis fighters set fire to many ordinary houses in addition to the churches in the days before they left, but ? possibly because there was no furniture left to burn since it all had been looted ? most of these houses look as if they could be made habitable after extensive repairs. It will take time because not only has the furniture gone, but cookers and fridges so, even if light fittings or taps are still in place, there is no water or electricity.28,000 people call Qaraqosh home. ?40,000 fled to safer locales in Europe and Asia Minor. ?As a result, there are still Christian in the region ? largely Syriac Catholics, one of the eastern rites (most of the west uses the Latin Rite) ? and the first thing they did was celebrate Mass in the Church of the Immaculate Conception for the first time in over two years.War still rages in the region, and not even fifty miles away, the battle is still being fought, thus giving credence to the insecurity of the residents. ?In addition, they have a message for America on the eve of the election.IRAQI Christians will pray for Donald Trump?s election victory after they condemned US Government for ?abandoning? them to the barbaric terror of Islamic State.The Christian community in the latest Iraqi town to be freed from ISIS have opened up about how they were terrorised at the hands of the twisted jihadi militants.The once-bustling Qaraqosh, which boasted of more than 50,000 Christian residents, was recaptured from the jihadis last week.Residents who stayed in the town have described how ISIS told every Christian to pay a massive tax, convert to Islam or face execution??Those who survived the terror have now voiced their outrage that President Obama refused to protect them when Iraq?s largest Christian city fell to ISIS more than two years ago.A man in the village said he hopes Donald Trump ? a widely favoured candidate in the town ? will bring a different approach to Iraqi Christians.He told the camera: ?Obama has never helped the Christians. In fact, he despises them. In the last 26 months, he has shown he despises all of them.?But we have hope in the new president, Trump.?Let?s just hope the Deplorables who make up the monster vote can beat out the election rigging.For more images, and a video of the return of chant to the church that so obviously sustained heavy damage during the ISIS occupation of Christian lands, please visit the Gateway Pundit.',fake
'America Trump supporters have allowed a false narrative to creep into the election and take on the acceptance, stature and significance of a fact. It?s a dangerous argument that has fundamentally weakened our position and our candidate. That argument is one heard far and wide, that this race has two deeply flawed candidates. Americans need to listen to what they?re saying, analyze and recognize it for the nonsensical political babble that it is.It?s a half truth. There is one highly flawed person in the two person race, a criminal that has sold out her nation and continues to do so even during the heat of the battle for the presidency. There is one habitual liar who has admitted that she has a public position and a private position on even the most important issues, who serves at the pleasure?the globalists who finance not only her campaign but every other aspect her miserable, corrupt existence, doing their bidding in destroying the United States in every manner imaginable.There is one candidate who does not give a damn about the Constitution, our bill of rights, our sovereignty or the rule of law. She is on the record as having stating her willingness and desire to flood this nation with foreigners of every description, legalizing all those who have violated our immigration laws within the first one hundred days and drastically increasing the number of Islamic terrorists that she allows into the United States. She will do so while endangering the lives of innocent Americans in the process, as a paid harlot of the America-haters, with no idea or concern of the type of individual she is bringing in or how many Americans will die as a result. The Marxist agenda and her fascist cronies will be served, not the American people.That is the terribly flawed candidate, Hillary Clinton. A criminal, a lifelong Marxist who has a history of intimate association with the communist party, a pathological liar who hates America, who will accelerate the Obama agenda of fundamental transformation to the point America is completely unrecognizable.Contrasted against that defective subhuman mongrel we are fortunate to have chosen an America-loving patriot as her opponent, Donald Trump. He?s a man who doesn?t lie to us and is criticized by the deceivers for his honesty and straight talk. He?s a man who is fighting a battle that no other candidate in the history of this nation has had to fight. Trump stands alone against the fascists, the globalists, the establishment, the academics, the Marxists, the foreigners, the terrorist sympathizers, the profiteers, the faux environmentalists, the Democrats, the social program parasites, the media whores and every other group that feeds off of the destruction and pillaging of the United States.We have a rare man in Donald Trump who has the strength of character and the will to stand up to this onslaught. He?s a man running for the right reasons, in service to his country and his fellow American, running for its survival in the face of tremendous odds. Trump is giving of himself and sacrificing himself so that his children and ours might have a future in the land that we all love, recognizing that it is in real peril and if this election is lost to the globalists so is this nation.Mr. Trump suffers personal ridicule and character assassination on our behalf that would cause lesser men to throw up their hands and walk away. He?s getting minimal support from the familiar establishment Judases who claim to be on his side, those who adorn themselves with a false mantle of conservatism as a means of deception. They are faces and names that are familiar, the traitors to this nation and the GOP, mouse-men like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Mitt Romney and any Bush.A lesser man would have given up by now, and God knows we?ve got a federal government full of lesser-thans of that caliber for reference. Yet Donald Trump goes on, doggedly, unshakable in his determination to do what is right for this nation, to be the man that saves America at its most vulnerable moment.We are fortunate to have an exceptional candidate in Donald Trump; the best and only man who could and would truly represent us rather than merely provide lip service as he slides the knife into our backs. We cannot survive more of that establishment type of turncoat that now fills Congress, the executive branch and the judiciary. They are the familiar serpents that cannot be trusted and who cannot tell the truth, who have brought our nation to the brink of destruction; the type of evil personified by Hillary Clinton.?This is not an election with two flawed candidates. This is an election with the worst of all candidates, one of the worst subhumans ever to draw a breath, facing off against a man of the caliber of a founding father, another Washington, Jefferson, Jackson or Reagan. We need to stop accepting the false proclamations of the lying media, stop allowing them to define the race in terms that suit their efforts to hide their candidate?s many flaws and our candidate?s extreme greatness.Donald Trump is the best of all candidates. He defeated 16 others who were all better choices than the woman he faces now. He is precisely the man America needs and we Americans need to become vocal in making that desperate need and our unwavering support known to everyone. We must recognize our good fortune and understand that the perfect candidate for the times is still not going to be a perfect man. There is no such thing. Finding the perfect leader to rescue us and our nation from certain destruction is all we can or should ask. The presidency is the toughest job in government. While Trump isn?t perfect, he?s close. As they say, close enough for government work. And much closer than anyone who?s been in there in decades.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'What is it with these second and third wave feminists who think that taking off their clothes makes their point for them? Amy Schumer, cousin or niece or some form of relative of New York Senator Chuck Schumer, has been taking off her clothes to make points for quite a while. Last year, she made a contribution to culture being Miss December on a calendar. ?This week, she put her bare torso on Instagram in full support of Hillary Clinton for President. (See the actual unaltered photo here.)Using the hashtag #StrongerTogether, the little Jewess put a caption on her photo with language that is verboten on this family-friendly site. ?Needless to say, many of us ladies have a simple message for little Miss Schumer and all the other women who think that nakedness is some sort of political statement.Yeah, it isn?t. ?The human body in all of its forms is beautiful, sensual, and has its place in art and science, but in the world of politics, a lot more gets done when everyone keeps their clothes on. ?Women like Schumer do not speak for the rest of us. ?They do not seem to believe that women think with something other than their vaginas and ovaries. ?Well, there are many of us out here on the fruited plain who DO NOT think with our lady parts, but our noggins. ?They are useful for something other than sporting the newest hair style.Amy Schumer received a lot of heat lately. Earlier this week, she was accused of cultural appropriation for her parody of Beyonce?s ?Formation.?She also sparked a massive walkout during a stand-up comedy show in Tampa where, after bashing Trump and his supporters, nearly 200 members of the audience booed and left the venue.I guess Amy was unaware that Tampa is Trump Country, as proven by the recent 20,000+ crowd that showed up to a rally on Monday night:Oops. ?Maybe that?s why she?s looking for attention in all the wrong places.(Sorry for not including the original photo, but there are legit reasons why we can?t.)',fake
'Anonymous says they have some information that, if it?s true, puts a whole different light on the Donald Trump video, one that they feel may spell the end for Hillary Clinton. We can hope they?re right.According to a video that Anonymous just released, they believe that the tape that is supposedly the actual recordings of Trump on a bus, out of view and with no video of the actual offensive comments being spoken, is a forgery. What?s even more earth-shattering is their belief that Trump is aware that it is forged, and is prepared to confront Clinton with the evidence on stage during the Sunday debates.Mr. Trump?s mannerisms to many of us who watched the video, once he got off of the bus, were a little inconsistent with the comments made but it?s possible he could have been putting on a good face. In light of his admission that he had said what was claimed, there was no need to question either that or the fact that the recordings were made out of view. Those questions may have now been asked and answered.Anonymous asked themselves why this information didn?t come out during the Republican primary, as millions of dollars were expended in opposition research at that time as? well and everybody was targeting Donald Trump.They believe the same firm that created fake al-Qaeda videos in the past is responsible for the forgery, the UK?s Bell Pottinger. They note that the fact that the incident that is portrayed in the video is over ten years old means that the people involved won?t have a clear recollection of what was said. ?This creates an opening for the operators to go in and enhance the audio,? said anonymous. ?We spoke with someone who does sound engineering and has been involved in high profile court cases where recorded sound has been used in evidence.?He told anonymous that it wouldn?t be that hard to create a fake tape of a sound recording that old. You find some similar voices, sample them and alter them to match. Changing a few words would be easy, adding a few sentences would be harder but still could be done. ?For that you have to match the cadence and depths,? he said, ?but you could do it.? He cites an example, ?If you wanted to change shoulder to pussy that would be easy.?The sound expert also raised an issue with the sound of the tic tacs and the ability to pick them up on the microphone. There is a strong likelihood that the sounds were added after the fact, by enhancement.Anonymous quotes what they identify as ?a contact close to Trump,? who said, ?Yes, there?s a lot of calls, a lot of fallout. Trump was asked to apologize immediately and he?s a team player so he did. But the core team is also very calm. They?re telling everyone to just wait for tomorrow night. This is sure to come up and they are just ready. They?re aching for it.?He continues, ?What we think is that they don?t just have a response but rather it?s a trap for Clinton. Trump moved immediately and called some of his guys, his investigative team that went after the birth certificate; good guys, very pro.? Trump had a copy of the tape rush delivered to a recording studio.?Now they?re huddling,? says anonymous, ?but they?re saying to everyone ?keep calm. Stay the course one more day. Just wait for the question and boom.?

'Mumbai.?The honorable Supreme Court?s order that Dahi Handi pyramid will have height restriction of 20 feet, proved costly for the medium pace bowler Ashok Dinda when he ?mistakenly broke the Dahi Handi of his society while bowling in a gully cricket match.Ashok Dinda is famous for the massive jumps and leaps he take while delivering a ball. He has always been at top position during his bowling career, his normal bowling style is Right arm over the wicket, 2ndfloor pavilion end.Dahi Handi last came in news when the Supreme Court in 2016 put the restriction on the height of Dahi Handi pyramid seeing the casualties happened due to it. However Supreme Court?s order was challenged by a Mumbai based Krida Mandal. Since, the courts and citizens are not sure whether it?s a ritual or a sport no decision has been taken yet. ??Ashok Dinda, an Indian cricketer, and usually a part of the bottom most teams of IPL table, got into a trouble while playing cricket in his society. Though it was gully cricket match, but Dinda being a professional cricket was all serious and started bowling in his own style. While taking run up, he jumped and accidentally touched the Dahi Handi of the society. Second time he did it with much more strength and not just touched the Dahi Handi but broke it unknowingly. Society president filed an FIR against Ashok Dinda later.It?s not the first time when Ashok Dinda has achieved something accidentally. Once trying to skip a pothole in Mumbai, Ashok Dinda jumped higher than usual and made the world record beating the then existing 2.45 m record. ?Whether Dahi Handi is a ritual or a sport is yet to be decided but the Supreme Court?s order to restrict the height of pyramid to 20 feet is for the safety of the participants and should be looked above the religion.',fake
'It?s one of the psy-ops operations that never seems to get any coverage. Unlike polls that are ?scientific? with ?methodology? that is more closely guarded than the nuclear missile codes and are designed to make it seem like one side is winning when it isn?t, online trolls and astroturf ?support? for any one candidate is a little hard to pin down. ?We all know how it works. ?Keyboard commandos sit behind the comfort of their flat screens, create fake accounts since most of social media is free, trash one candidate or another, and get paid for the effort.In the conservative website world of the internet, we?ve seen this for a couple decades. ?Anyone who spent any amount of time on Free Republic back in the day and remembers ZOT! and the Viking Kitties knows about trolls.In 2016, though, the online army working to create the impression that Hillary Clinton?s support is a lot wider and deeper than it really is got a bit cocky and other users got suspicious.Savvy Reddit users outed one of the Clinton staffers,?Adam Parkhomenko, her director of grassroots engagement, who was apparently posting anonymously on the site threatening Trump supporters.

'Dinesh Chandimal-led Sri Lanka are on the brink of a series whitewash in the?third and final Test?against India commencing on August 12. So far in the series, injury-stricken Sri Lanka have failed to tick the right boxes. India has been totally dominant in the series and now they feel that this series was a complete waste for them. Instead they could have scheduled a series with a stronger team.BCCI has been criticized for organizing such series when the Indian team is number one in tests and should compete with the stronger teams. The only people watching the India Lanka series are the people who don?t have jobs or are not interested in searching a job for themselves.

'It?s been six weeks since the hunt for the coach began after the fall out between Kohli and Kumble that saw the latter withdrawing from the race, and every passing day has produced twists, turns, controversies, melodrama. Complications arose as the CAC also appointed in the form of ?consultants? for batting (Rahul Dravid) and bowling (Zaheer Khan), which did not seem to sit well with Shastri. Now to manage all this chaos, BCCI has decided that it will hire a consultant who will choose which consultant should accompany the team on its overseas tours.BCCI has finally woke up and taken note of the chaos surrounding its processes and a consultant will surely bring back some much needed sanity in the cricketing environment. The selection process for the consultants will be quite simple. The candidates will be interviewed by a panel of 3 consultants who will ask them their views on providing consultancy to the team during the tough overseas tours. The only thing which is not cleared yet is the process to select the panel of consultants who will choose the consultant who in turn will choose the consultant for the tour. According to BCCI sources, it is not as difficult as it seems and the process will likely get over in 1 year time.Journalists, cricket fans and the cricketers themselves have approved of this decision by the BCCI and can now hope for the team performing exceedingly well on tours of England, SA and Aus. Till the time the consultant is hired, Ravi Shastri has decided to invite Sachin to give batting tips to the team. Ravi spoke to the faking news team and had this to say,?

'Dr. Ben Carson gets it just as Donald Trump gets it, there is a sense of urgency to the situation the United States finds itself in. The wrong decision by the people of this nation on November 8th in supporting more of the same will be our undoing.Dr. Carson responded to the Gettysburg Address of Donald Trump saying, ?I think he knows that we?re down to the Crux now, and really, I?m glad he?s beginning to talk this way, because as I?ve said for a long period of time, this election is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This election is about the status quo, the political class versus we, the people.?Carson continues, ?And it will make all the difference in the world in terms of what happens to our children and our grandchildren and the country from now on. If you look at the platforms and the policies of these two candidates, they go off in starkly different directions. And I think one of the reasons that the group that doesn?t want to talk about the issues spends all of this time creating distractions is because they want to make sure that the people don?t know that we have a possibility of going off in a deeply different direction than the founders of this nation intended.? ??Or that anybody actually thinks that we?re going off into,? says Dr. Carson, ?and they?ll be there and they?ll say ?how did we get here??

I do not believe that they are as simplistic as many people in the political class think they are, and the media think they are. They think they can be so easily manipulated, I think many people take offense at that. And when you look at the crowds and the enthusiasm for Trump versus Clinton, that?s telling you something. And that?s really the reason they?re coming out with all of this fire, because they?re seeing it too.

'It?s the story that only Fox News seems to be covering with any sort of intensity. ?Marc Turi, a licensed arms dealer who created the scheme to arm Libyan rebels around UN sanctions in 2011, was set up to take the fall for the Benghazi disaster as well as the end result of the arming of the Libyan Transitional Government ? those weapons ended up in Syria, among other places ? and the Obama Administration ultimately let him go. ?Why? ?Because his testimony, and the classified statements of CIA personnel put the blame for all of it squarely on the shoulders of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The Obama Administration dropped the charges against Turi to protect her.Dizzy yet? ?Hang on.The story begins in 2011 when Libyian officials started to defect from?Mouamar Gaddaffi?s regime. ?In order for the U.S. to arm the rebels, weapons had to go through other countries. ?In this case, specifically, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were used as the conduits. ?According to Turi, the Clinton State Department used the plan, ?Operation Zero Footprint?, but not him. ?Instead, Mrs. Clinton used her own people to do the gun running. ?And that, Turi claims, is how the weapons escaped and ended up in the hands of entities related to the Muslim Brotherhood. ?(Conservative Treehouse has a long explanation of how it all went down.)As of early 2012, the Clinton State Department did have an effort underway to find and buy back the weapons, but by then the genie was out of the bottle and U.S. military forces were seeing weapons made in America shooting at them.In February of 2012 Asst. Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro admitted the State Department had been attempting to relocate and buy-back those weapons since August of 2011. However, on September 11th 2012, while those efforts were still ongoing, the attacks in Benghazi against the U.S. State Department Ambassador Chris Stevens took place, and four Americans were killed.Two years later, the Obama Department of Justice charged Marc Turi, the architect of the plan that was taken from him and then failed, with ?non-registered weapons shipments.? ?He was set up to take the fall.Turi?s defense was that the weapons were unregistered because the State Department and the CIA needed covert cover. Elements within the CIA confirmed the basic outline for Turi?s assertion.In 2015 Turi provided Fox News with documents and email exchanges he had with high-level members of Congress as well as military, and State Department employees to back up his claim that the Obama administration authorized in 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, a covert weapons program that spun out of control.Marc Turi?s legal defense team said if the DOJ was going to prosecute him for the arms shipments, his defense would necessarily reveal how Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was actually the driver of the entire program.And that is why Marc Turi is now walking free despite being ruined by the Obama Administration. ?His story is the one that the Special Committee on Benghazi is looking for for background on why Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other men died in Benghazi, Libya in September 11, 2012. ?His gun running program was being directed by Hillary Clinton and her people.The DOJ tried to claim ?national security? issues and keep the aspects relating to the U.S. State Department and Secretary Clinton under wraps during the pre-trial motions. However, a federal judge ruled a few days ago the defense was allowed to use the documented evidence Turi possessed to defend himself.The case was slated to begin trial on November 8th, the same day as the U.S. presidential election.As a direct consequence of that ruling, the DOJ announced last week they were dropping all the charges.And yet only Fox News is carrying the story, the one that answers so many questions, and ties up a lot of loose ends in the Hillary Clinton scandal machine. ?At least as it pertains to Benghazi.',fake

'The poll was conducted after the announcement on Friday by FBI Director James Comey that the?agency was going to be re-examining ?emails that might be related to Hillary?s email server. It surveyed 659 people who had already voted or are likely to vote Nov. 8.Almost a third of respondents in the WRAL News poll ranked trustworthiness as the most important consideration in voting for president. Positions on issues were rated most important by 40 percent, while experience and character were far behind at 17 and 8 percent, respectively.WRAL reports: Of those ranking trustworthiness most important, 83 percent favor Trump. He also wins among those most concerned about issues, 52 to 43 percent. Clinton was favored by 93 percent of those most concerned with experience, and she doubled up Trump among voters concerned about character, 58 to 26 percent.Breaking down the results, Trump has flipped the gender gap in recent weeks, cutting Clinton?s 12-point lead among women down to 7 points while widening his dominance among male voters from 9 points to 23 points. He also has erased her lead among voters 50 and older, moving from a 5-point deficit to an 11-point advantage, while maintaining his slight lead among voters ages 18 to 49. 3Clinton?s sizable lead in North Carolina?s metro areas also has eroded since early October.

'One of the checks that Desai had to deliver was a personal gift to Bill Clinton from the government of Qatar, the terrorist-friendly nation to where the Gitmo terrorists supposedly traded for Bowe Bergdahl were released. They?re no longer under custody, their remaining sentence was shortened to one year. Obama says they?re rehabilitated though, so it?s not a concern.Qatar thinks highly of Bill Clinton, with rape not carrying the stigma for the offender in Islamic nations that it does for non-Clintons in the US and elsewhere. In fact, in Qatar it is legal for a man to rape his wife. Bill?s a good old standard redneck and to show how much they value his friendship, the Qatari King gave him a million bucks. It had nothing to do with his wife being Secretary of State at the time, in April of 2012.The information about the gift to Bill comes from the wealth of documents provided by WikiLeaks, in an?email from Desai to four different Clinton Foundation employees. As Desai was informing the recipients in the email that he had the check for Bill, he also made them aware that the Qataris were looking for ?investments? in Haiti, or scams as they might otherwise known.The overly generous amount may seem strange but it?s important to remember that he is one third of the Clinton in Clinton Foundation. Another third, his wife Hillary, had the ability to look the other way when terrorist groups and their supporters appeared on the State Department radar. With just the right kind of motivation everybody wins.It was a couple of years after this birthday gift was awarded that ISIS made their breakout run across Iraq and Syria. It would have taken about that much time to equip and train a terrorist army and to set up the logistics, recruitment, and communication capability, all of the startup headaches associated with?a fledgling terrorist state.The last thing the Saudis or Qataris would want is the US condemning their new joint terrorist endeavor. We know that Hillary Clinton and those receiving intelligence briefings were aware of the ISIS creation and growth so perhaps this gesture of good will helped to ease their concerns that ISIS might somehow become a barbaric, fundamental Islamic, anti-human rights paramilitary force. That makes a lot more sense than the story given at the time by the Clinton operative, particularly since the email was dated April 16th and Clinton?s birthday is August 19th.The birthday seems like a convenient excuse, and a particularly lame one, for the sale of State Department approval of their terrorist organization. That would explain how ISIS was able to travel across open desert without being annihilated and why they were allowed to operate, pump oil and grow without the necessary force being directed to stop them.It reeks of pay for play but that?s nothing unusual for the Clintons.

We?re looked down upon by the criminal elites who believe they are better than us because we aren?t are too backwards to be willing to pillage our nation as a means to achieving wealth. We?re not willing to sell out our children?s future and our fellow citizens? present in the interest of obtaining high dollar foreign bribes or simply just reckless endangerment through insufficient or nonexistent security measures. We?re deplorable.Hillary Clinton demeaned us as being on whole a collection of ?racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic? Neanderthals. They were comments that Mr. Trump labeled as showing ?her true contempt for everyday Americans.?But her husband,?Bill Clinton the rapist, has plenty of contempt of his own for the patriotic Americans standing between them and eight more years of unbridled plunder. His ?howdy, aw shucks, golly, this is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me? shtick is growing a little tiresome and has lost any effect at diffusing or defecting away from his Bubba the Rapist President persona. Clinton tells us he?s just a good old country boy from rural Arkansas who happens to like having sex with unwilling partners. Everybody needs a hobby. We can?t hold it against him nor should we fault his wife for intimidating, harassing and threatening his victims into silence. That?s just the Clintons being the Clintons, after all.His three accusers at the debate helped focus attention on the crimes of the former president. Likewise the rash of protesters shouting ?Bill Clinton is a Rapist? at their notoriously low turnout events where the speaker is easily distracted has contributed to the discussion, in spite of the mainstream propagandists? best efforts to cover it up.Good old Biting Bill, who bloodied Juanita Broaddrick?s lip by biting on it excessively in the excitement of the rape, had a few more words to say in expressing his hatred for the patriots of America obstructing his path to riches. He knows who they are, and it?s nobody. They?re not like him, he rose above them and became important, but he still remembers what the Trump supporters are like from growing up in their ?wretchedness.?He told his small audience, as if he were the candidate and not his wife, ?Look man, the other guy?s base is what I grew up in. You know I?m basically your standard redneck.? Clinton is wrong, either deliberately or by mistake. He may have been able to claim that moral high ground of being a redneck of good character, one of the honest country folks of America at a point in his life. But it was long ago. The ?rednecks? are good people who have nothing in common with the Clintons.His attempts to include himself or equate themselves with American rednecks is exceedingly offensive. It?s far worse than being described by the words deplorable, unredeemable, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, or Islamaphobic. Being compared to a Clinton, as in being labeled a Democrat or like Obama, is the worst type of insult that one person can direct towards a patriot.

In a press conference?on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah urged election commissioner to conduct the next Loksabha elections on twitter.?Right from 2014 elections, BJP had a strong grip on Twitter and has maintained it till date. It was after losing the 2014 Lok Sabha election, that Congress realized the power of social media. Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi has asked all the INC members to be active on various social media platforms. Rahul Gandhi himself doesn?t have any social media account and his office account @OfficeOfRG tweets his whereabouts.?Congress?s official handle has started a new hashtag, #KnowYourLegacy, under which it conducts polls. The aim of the poll is to make people aware about various good work that congress has done during its regime. What congress is trying to do is not going its way.

'No this is not a joke, and it is not satire. ?As part of its investigation into Hillary Clinton and her illegal email practices, between subpoenas from the FBI via the State Department and Freedom of Information Act requests, the FBI did a number of interviews with former and current State Department people, and within those interviews comes the stunning information that in 2014, somehow, two boxes of Hillary Clinton?s emails disappeared. ?From Fox News:Buried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery ? about two missing ?bankers boxes? filled with the former secretary of state?s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file ? with a staggering 111 redactions ? that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the ?Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).? The employee told the FBI that, ?Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON?s emails at CLINTON?s Friendship Heights office.??Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that ?on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON?s emails from Williams & Connolly.Yes, this is a little confusing, but our good friend at Fox, Judge Andrew Napolitano was kind enough to unravel the mystery of where the two boxes in question originated, and why there is a real problem with them going missing.So, not only was all the information on where the emails traveled missing because Hillary & Company thought they would pull a fast one and PRINT them rather than provide the electronic files to the FBI, but somewhere between her office, her lawyer?s office and the FBI picking up the evidence during discovery, two boxes turn up missing.And the Clinton Campaign and mainstream media want us to concentrate on an eleven year old men?s locker room conversation where her presidential race opponent was talking like an alpha male about women. ?Uh-huh.Yes, there?s a constant drip, drip, drip of damning information, and the presidential election is running interference with help from the mainstream media. ?The whole thing stinks just the same. ?The interviews with staffers tell of a mystery within a mystery of names redacted and one high-level staffer trying to get Hillary Clinton?s email address removed from the source files.',fake

'It may not have been the October Surprise Julian Assange was promising, or even James O?Keefe for that matter, but when James Comey announced on Friday that the FBI was looking into additional Hillary Clinton emails found during a completely different investigation, all hell broke loose on the American political landscape.There is no comprehensive timeline as yet in this whole episode of the Foggy Bottom Theater of Scandal, BUT a few juicy tidbits have trickled out.D.C. Whispers is reporting that Comey did not inform anyone in the administration of his decision to inform Congress that he was looking into the emails found in the ?unrelated investigation,? which we all now know is the former Congressman Anthony Weiner?s underage sex case.Rumors are now circulating that FBI Director James Comey has gone rogue. His decision to inform members of Congress (both Democrats and Republicans) that new and potentially critical evidence has surfaced related to the months-ago concluded Hillary Clinton illegal server/private email scandal, has sent ripples of stunned shock throughout the entirety of the Obama administration, and left the Clinton campaign bracing for what could be stunning pre-Election Day fallout.As of now, the still-developing story goes something like this:Comey recently learned of new information linked to the infamous FBI Hillary Clinton investigation concluded last summer. He acted quickly to inform leading members of Congress on what he found, telling Attorney General Loretta Lynch he felt ?compelled? to do so. That act was in direct violation of Lynch?s wishes that no such public revelation be forthcoming prior to the presidential election.In fact, some are suggesting Lynch had already promised both President Obama, and Hillary Clinton, that the Comey decision would not be made public before Election Day.And then it was ? leaving Obama, Lynch, and Clinton furious.As it happens, Judicial Watch actually knew for some time that Huma Abedin had been forwarding emails to her personal email address on Yahoo for years. ?What they did not know, was where they would be found: on Weiner?s notebook computer. ?And here?s the kicker?THERE?S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM. from Zero Hedge:It remains to be seen just what is in the emails, although whether Hillary sent emails with confidential content herself, or directed, or simply allowed her closest aide, Huma Abedin to forward such emails to her outside unsecured email address (where they subsequently ended up on Anthony Weiner?s notebook), is what this latest case will be all about and how it will be defended and prosecuted in the media, by the water coolers and perhaps, in court.However, we do know one thing: according to the NYT, the number of Huma emails that made their way to Weiner?s PC was staggering:The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case ? one federal official said they numbered in the tens of thousands.Sundance over at Conservative Treehouse is reporting the same information in addition to the fact that it was the New York Police Department that first found this stash of emails. They turned them over to the FBI field office in New York.Why Abedin would do this is a matter for speculation at this point ? and the comment galleries on Reddit, Free Republic, and elsewhere are all speculating away. (The most popular theory is that the emails were a form of life insurance.) ?The end result, though, is that Huma Abedin is not with the Clinton Campaign for president on their current trip. ?From Red State Watcher:Huma Abedin has VOIDED her immunity deal with the FBI. This means she has to sing or face jail time. Hillary Clinton no longer wants her around. According to reporters on Hillary?s campaign, Abedin is no longer sitting near the front cabin on her plane to Florida. She?s no where to be found this morning.One of the emails in the Podesta cache indicated that Huma was the ?institutional knowledge? of Hillary?s public service. ?If that is the case, she could make a star witness for anyone investigating the crime syndicate since the voiding of her immunity deal was more in the way of lying about her actions under oath. ?A new one can always be issued.The big question now, is what is in those tens of thousands of emails?

It?s not like they had insulted a ?real religion,? right Tim, like Islam? You Democrats would be twisting each other?s panties into knots and wringing your hands bloody if somebody in your camp had insulted the pet religion. Christians are fair game anytime.According to documents released by WikiLeaks, Jen Palmieri was engaged in a 2011 discussion with a Democrat strategist who denounced what he described as the Catholics? ?severely backwards gender relations.? Palmieri responded that ?some conservatives are only Catholic because they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion.?Martha Raddatz says that many took offense to the perceived mockery and offered slimy Tim a chance to squirm his campaign?s way out of it. Before he attempts to spin the situation into something harmless, the sleaze ball first feels obligated to discredit WikiLeaks, who has a one hundred percent accuracy record on their releases, saying that he doesn?t give them any credence. Of course you don?t you crooked weasel, they?re exposing your corruption.Raddatz pointed out that the author of the email acknowledged that he said it, to which Kaine deftly replied, ?Yeah, I, but, but,? but I, I, this is an important topic that everybody needs to know about these emails.? This dolt just said everybody needs to know about the emails? That was in the next breath after he said, ?I don?t even know if they?re accurate and they are part of an effort by the Russians and WikiLeaks to ?destabilize the election.? Right, the Russians wrote all of those emails and signed everybody?s names to them too, didn?t they Tim?This dull blade went on national television where a question is asked that he should have expected, in which the interviewer had time to verify the veracity of it but their ?communications director didn?t? His default response is the same as his running mate, dismiss, divert and play dumb. In his case, there might not be much acting involved. He raises the inevitable ?one email? that doesn?t really exist that was inaccurate for reasons he doesn?t know as his best lame defense. Way to hit it out of the park, Kaine.The abortion advocate goes on to the topic of his Catholicism, which he says he?s ?very serious about? and Hillary Clinton views it as an asset. Kaine, who wears a Clinton pin rather than an American flag pin in recognition of the candidate who also wears no American flag pin, says Clinton values his faith. He knows it?s true because he and Clinton have each discussed their ?faith backgrounds,? and that was part of why she just had to have him on the ticket. The more he talks the less believable his lies become.Asked if an apology would be forthcoming, Kaine said ?We all have opinions and I don?t think you need to apologize for your opinions.? Good thing Tim, because everyone in the audience is of the opinion that you?re a useless boob. It would have been interesting to hear his?response if they had accused Muslims of being believers of convenience or having severely backwards gender relations, what with women having to cover their faces, walk behind men and not drive a car.Would that have been acceptable and dismissed as just an opinion as well, Mr. Kaine? Would that have been part of Clinton?s ?respect for the Church and people?s faith lives?? Of course not; there?s a double standard for everything with Democrats. Christians are always fair game, Muslims never are.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'An excise duty higher than the price of a cigarette. Death of father due to excessive smoking. Watching Mukesh on the deathbed in cinema halls. Two broken relationships due to bad breath. Rahul Dravid getting run out due to partner?s mistake. All these could not deter 25-year-old Raunak from smoking, until the price of mouth freshener increased after the introduction of GST.Raunak, a resident of New Delhi, got addicted to smoking soon after his father, who was a chain smoker, passed away due to lung cancer. Despite making several efforts to quit the harmful habit, he failed. Friends and family eventually distanced themselves from Raunak owing to the habit. ?Both my girlfriends started dating me when they realised that I am rich as I spent a huge amount on cigarettes,? said Raunak, who regrets smoking as the same girls left him for his horrible breath. After the implementation of GST, Raunak could not afford to buy the expensive chewing gum which had served him as a mouth freshener for years. ?Every time I bought myself a chewing gum, the thought of not being able to buy a mouth freshener killed me more than the tobacco in a cigarette ever can!? he said, ?and I had to, eventually, quit it.?Earlier this month, the Supreme Court faced immense pressure to ban cigarettes in the view of environment protection. Raunak?s decision to quit smoking was hailed by the Supreme Court. ?After banning the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR, people started questioning us about the pollution caused by due to smoking. Rather than banning cigarettes and tobacco, we chose to increase the price of mouth fresheners,? said a judge at the Supreme Court.The move has been termed a major success by environmentalists across the country. Judges at the Supreme Court burst firecrackers outside the court to celebrate their victory over pollution.',fake
'Goa: The recently concluded BRICS summit brought the leaders of 5 big big economies together in their fight against terrorism. There was a consensus related to actions against terrorist outfits.The leaders discussed on all?things other than terrorism, that included food, culture, hobbies and future aspirations. The Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has as many as 1 billion pronunciations in India, was very vocal about his distaste for Indian Chinese food. Indians have literally customized the Chinese menu according to their own taste.Some of the famous Chinese food on Indian menu are ?Gobi Manchurian?, ?Paneer Chilly?, ?Chinese Bhel? and lot more. It?s a surprise that Chinese have no clue about what these fucking dishes are, and Indians are selling it with the brand name of China.Xi Jinping was very furious with the dish name ?Chinese Bhel?, as it is just a disproportionate mixture of all Chinese ingredients. He strongly condemned the invention of such dishes in India. In fact, he has urged PM Modi to personally look into the matter and ban the dish across India. Once the dish is completely banned in India, China will withdraw its support to Pakistan, he assured.Indians are very attached to the Chinese Bhel, and it seems very difficult to ban it in near future, but with China?s offer of isolating Pakistan, we can very well think of implementing the ban.Or else, we should at least change the name of the dish, for 11 Jinping?s sake.',fake
'It was sort of inevitable actually. ?When Donald Trump made some pretty strong statements about China and their exploitative exportation habits that he would see curbed with a hefty tariff, there was a pall in the pollution coming from Beijing and Shanghai. ?The Chinese were not amused. ?Now that Mr. Trump is president elect despite the best efforts to derail the movement he put a face on, the Chinese made the opening salvo in the potential trade war.An opinion piece was published on Monday in the Global Times, a communist party mouthpiece, decrying the rhetoric and threatening American business interests in the country.?A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted.

We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president,? the Global Times wrote.It has been noted that 45\% was either a number Trump just tossed out, or it was a starting place for negotiation. ?The reality is that without the United States, China would have a much harder time selling its goods, even if they do make things quick, dirty and cheap. ?Some examples:Oh, that?s right. ?The Chinese don?t have copyright infringement ? or stealing trade secrets ? in their culture. ?At least not coming from the government.The specific threats to Apple and Boeing are fairly ripe targets given the iconic nature of the companies involved. Boeing is operating in China sort of by invitation?(more like a threat) since the Chinese insist that the products sold in their country be made there (basically so they can steal the technology), and Apple is making the iPhone there simply because there is no tariff and if they made their products in the U.S. at this point the phones would be twice as expensive, and far more of a status symbol than they already are.And in the cheap crap mode of Chinese goods, this writer had one that would just quit working whenever it felt like it, hence a switch to Android. ?Am saving up for an iBook, though.Has a trade war really begun? ?Maybe, maybe not. ?President-Elect Trump did have a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week. ?The Trump team said there was mutual respect. ?We?ll see.More at Extreme Tech.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyVisits Counter \r\n',fake

'Mumbai:?Citizens across Mumbai have collectively issued an apology to news editors for ignoring floods in Assam and not reporting on them extensively. Questions were raised by several news editors over lack of coverage of Assam floods in the media and Mumbaikars have put their hands up and taken full responsibility for it.As Mumbai roads got flooded yesterday after the heavy rains, every news channel started covering the Mumbai rains and ran minute by minute coverage from the financial capital of India. Every drop of rain was captured by media and this focus led several news editors to question the difference in media coverage between Assam and Mumbai floods.Speaking to Faking News, a Dadar resident said ,?As responsible citizens, it is our duty to cover all the important news from every corner of the country but we dropped the ball in Assam. We totally ignored the floods there but talked about the flooding outside our homes nonstop for the past 24 hours. After reading all the tweets from news editors criticizing the lack of coverage of Assam, we realized how selfish we have been. We sincerely apologize for our mistake and promise to correct it as soon as possible.?Another Mumbai resident from Parel echoed similar sentiments. He said ,?I am immediately leaving for Assam. From there, I will update live pictures of the floods and will provide details of the relief measures needed in the state. As citizens, it is our duty to cover news from remote places.?Several news editors have appreciated this apology but have also asked why is there no coverage of Gorkhaland agitation in the media.',fake
'Appearing exhausted and spent after the debate Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton made her way back to the microphone-holding boot-lickers to give them their next message to put out on behalf of the Democrat Party.Clinton told the suck-ups in her posse that she was both relieved and grateful that there were no more debates. The relieved part makes sense, she doesn?t have worry as much about having another seizure or fit in front of America. She can now keep her events to less than ninety minutes, to a length that will allow her to not have to take medication rest days in order to survive an hour and a half public appearance.\r\nClinton is grateful, apparently to the adoring press and others, who have looked the other way as she has committed fraudulent acts and struggled to maintain appearances. They could have told the story as it was happening but thanks to them and some equally corrupt Secret Service Agents, the American people will remain ignorant and this unfit criminal may end up in office.The diminutive criminal granny laments that she won?t be getting anymore naps now that the debates are all done. The two should have nothing to do with each other were she not attempting to manage her serious medical condition. Now that those ?long? ninety-minute symptom free periods are less of an issue, she?s not going to be needing her nappy time.She?s asked if she?ll respect the results of the election and never answers, instead choosing to vilify Trump for again telling the truth, this time regarding the fraud and coercion being carried out against him. Trump admitted he reserves the right to challenge manipulated or fraudulent results. Clinton won?t admit that she?d do exactly that, if she were on the side that is not manipulating and committing fraud. Since she?s the criminal, she?s attacking him for exposing her.In her attack on Trump, Clinton, of all people, actually says that the United States is ?a country based on laws.? She?s unable to do it with a straight face, having to exaggerate the point with raised eyebrows, closed eyes and a head wobble. Right, Mrs. Clinton, that?s three sets of laws to be exact. There?s one for the elite establishment criminals, one for the imported replacement Americans, and one for your enemies, the American people.Most of the rest of the video is more of the media allowing the focus to be directed away from what is important onto superfluous side issues. None of the order takers took advantage of the jaw-dropping ?country based on laws? comment, although that?s the kind of thing journalists are supposed to do. It simply wouldn?t be servile enough to ask of Mrs. Clinton, therefore it?s not appropriate.One of those huddled around her did summon up the integrity and courage to ask about the Project Veritas videos. Clinton?s response was similar to what she told the FBI when asked about many of her other crimes. She simply claimed ignorance, stating, ?You know I know nothing about all of this, I can?t deal with every one of his conspiracy theories, but I hope you all have something to eat and something to drink on the way back to New York.?Of course they are not conspiracy theories, they are conspiracy realities with video evidence that was strong enough to force the resignation of two of their chief racketeers. One of those goons has visited the White House 342 time since 2009, 47 of those meetings were face to face with Obama. That goes far beyond mere hyperbole.Clinton took off like a scalded cat when the subject that could undo every false assertion she had just made being broached. She offered a bribe of food to the order takers, and something to drink before turning tail and bolting away, with a finger effectively stuck in each ear.We get the message, Clinton, ? Take some free food, get drunk, I?m outta here. And get that reporter who asked the taboo corruption and racketeering question off of my plane now.

'The corrupt individuals behind the equally corrupt candidate have unleashed their assault on Donald Trump in the form of an eleven year old video tape. That?s supposed to completely distract the American people and so outrage us by the language that he used that we will completely ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is a traitor to America and that her criminal syndicate includes most of the government that props her up.One of those intertwined in the corrupt snake den of Washington DC is John Podesta, her campaign chairman. He was also Bill Clinton?s chief of staff at the White House and Obama?s senior advisor on issues including the hoax designed specifically to steal power and money from the US and other citizens and line the pockets of the globalist pirates, climate change.After hearing that WikiLeaks had released some of his hacked emails, the high and mighty Podesta tried to do two things, deflect away from the content and imply that others were guilty of the same things. His first of four Tweets attempted to do both, saying, ?While I?m in pretty good company with Gen. Powell & Amb. Marshall??The second was a diversion from the content and another attempt at the same tactic that has been in play since the first DNC email problems became evident, the claim that Russians are to blame. He wrote, ? I?m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump.? The odds are that since he and his syndicate were able to sell America?s uranium to the Russians for a huge profit and to their strategic military benefit, they are probably not?in Trump?s corner. As for the larger claim of ?the Russians did it,? Podesta?s not a stupid man so his complete missing of the point is obviously deliberate. It doesn?t really matter who exposed what he was doing, he was still doing it.Next he implied, without actually having to lie about any specific documents which could later be disproven, that the documents and the information they contained was false. ?Don?t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked?,? the busy little international mobster wrote.He then went on to parse a completely irrelevant point that about the current ownership structure of the influence peddling company that he and his brother started and operate, the Podesta Group. He said, ?But, for starters, Assange?s first claim that I co-own the Podesta Group is completely false.?We might also inquire of Mr. Podesta if the clients who they act as a spokesperson and advocate in the halls of government inside the United States are also false or it they are?correctly listed on their Wikipedia page as: Wal-Mart, BP, Lockheed Martin, Abdisalam Omer, American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Amgen, Bank Of America, Cherokee Nation (Casinos), Cintas, Covidien, Duke Energy, Egypt, Genentech, General Dynamics, Harrah?s Entertainment, Heineken, Merck, Michelin, National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), National Public Radio (NPR), Nestle, Novartis, Orange County, Florida, Raytheon, Reed Elsevier, Republic of Albania, Republic of Georgia, Sallie Mae, Sunoco, Synthetic Genomics, TJX Companies, Tyco Electronics, Republic of Kenya and United Technologies.We could also ask if there were any conflicts of interest in the decisions made by the White House while he was a senior adviser or his candidate the Secretary of State that would have benefited any of those he represents for a fee. The authoritarian government of Azerbaijan has his company on a monthly retainer of $60,000 plus expenses. What are they getting in return?His client ?Abdisalam Omer is a dual citizen Somali American who has held positions as the Chief of Staff of the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Director of the UNDP Somalia Financial Services and Governance Program, and a Chief Business Officer for the District of Columbia Public Schools. He also served as Governor of the Central Bank of Somalia in 2013 and, as of February 2015, is the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Somalia.Did his representation play a role quashing the DC school voucher program or in the high levels of Somali immigration into the US? It seems to be the most likely explanation for both nonsensical federal actions under this regime.And how about Obama?s trip to Kenya and all the taxpayer money he promised to throw their way. Was that just based upon his birth connection or was there a little of the customary pay for play being exercised there as well??And those potential and likely conflicts of interest don?t even get into the defense contractors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and bankers on your client list.How deep does the corruption go?

'Project Veritas did some of their usual great hidden camera investigative reporting, with Hillary Clinton campaign workers, engaged in voter registration. They reveal a bias against registering Republicans, which is not surprising, on the part of the Democrats. They aren?t supposed to destroy the registration forms, though.At the first part of the video a worker identified as Mark Hodges, a Hillary Clinton field organizer, describes ?bolting? when he encountered what he took to be a Trump supporter. He headed for the other side of the parking lot, avoided contact and having to register the enemy.Trevor Lafauci is a campaign coordinator for the Clinton campaign. He explains that those who want to register as Democrats are offered the opportunity to vote by mail. If they want to register as Republicans, the offer is not made. Voting by mail is just too easy and extending that same opportunity would have the effect of eliminating a Democrat advantage. Why would they fight voter ID laws tooth and nail and then not utilize them to commit voter fraud?A Project Veritas reporter told Mr. Lafauci that he had ripped up three Republican voter registration forms or ballots, and asked if he would get in trouble for doing it. He was reassured by Mr. Lafauci that he would not get in trouble and that it would not be reported to anyone. He thanked him for being conscientious enough to report it to him.He makes his small talk and excuses for effect and then asks Lafauci one last time if he?s ?cool with it.? Lafauci says that he is, as long as the reporter doesn?t make a habit of it.That was the pretext upon which the confrontation was based later, with a Project Veritas reporter coming in an asking Lafauci about that very incident. The report asks, ?I was just wondering, is the Hillary campaign staff okay with ripping up voter registrations for Republicans??He plays dumb, saying, ?I?m not sure what you?re talking about.? He?s reminded of the earlier conversation with a ?Project Veritas reporter named Max,? whom he denies knowing. The reporter asks how he respond to video if he had it in his possession with Lafauci talking to Max and telling him it?s okay to rip up Republican ballots and that he wouldn?t be reported, asking him if he doesn?t want to comment on that.As he reminds him of the comment about not making a habit out of it, the second bolt of the video is engaged in, as he heads for the parking lot and the safety of his vehicle.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'The Obama Clinton corruption is everywhere. An FBI official who was promoted during the investigation of Hillary Clinton and her obvious criminal actions received $675,000 in cash and services into their household in the form of ?campaign donations? to his wife. Oddly, she seems to have not been seriously entertaining the notion of running for office prior to being selected by the corrupt Governor of Virginia, seemingly out of the blue. She had to be convinced in a private meeting with Governor Terry McAuliffe, the former DNC Chief, and close Clinton ally to run, ?for the good of the state.?The donations took the form of $467,500 in cash and another $207,788 worth of support in the form of campaign mailers. The candidate was Dr. Jill McCabe, who met with McAuliffe only once. In that meeting he persuaded her to embark on her unsuccessful run for the Virginia State Senate. Her husband is Andrew McCabe, has since been promoted to deputy director of the FBI and had oversight of Clinton?s case once promoted.It?s an interesting theory, that McAuliffe or his representatives identified McCabe as a potential willing accomplice and promised him, his wife, or both, that they would shower her with cash and perhaps a seat in the State?s Senate and to give him a nice promotion. All he had to do in return was to deep six the Clinton investigation or agree to go along with the decision of their compromised Director, James Comey.According to the Wall Street Journal, ?A spokesman for the governor said he ?supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors? Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous.\'? Put more correctly, anyone who believes this crooked Democrat?s line of crap is an idiot. Of course it was a relatively clean way for them to funnel large amounts of money to her in exchange for political favors. It?s the quid pro quo that Clinton and her circle of corruption thrive upon.The excuses from the FBI and those involved in the scheme are laughable in their criminal transparency and dependence upon the naivet? of the public for their consumption. The FBI issued a statement saying that Mr. McCabe ?played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton?s emails.?Did he help her spend the money? Did he eat any of the food or stay in the house it paid for? And does it really matter that they chose not to promote her husband during the campaign? They put him where he needed to be to benefit Mrs. Clinton when he needed to be there. The campaign was primarily a way to move the money from Democrat fundraisers to one of those who held the decision making power over their future nominee. A time lag provided them with a weak, but their only remotely plausible deniability.The already compromised Comey FBI is providing protection for McCabe and themselves, stating that he recognized the conflict of interest and covered himself by seeking ?ethics advice? from the bureau and following it. They instructed him to abstain from involvement in public corruption cases in Virginia or campaign activities. That advice did not extend to the most corrupt individual in all of the federal government, whom he became a de facto agent in support and protection of, Hillary Clinton.In their claims of innocence, the McCabes insist on directing the attention towards the Virginia race, their safe zone from the obvious big picture conflict of interest. Dr. McCabe offered the sophomoric excuse, ?Once I decided to run,?[and accept 2/3 of a million bucks and a great job for my husband], ?my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official?everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate.?He was supportive but had no formal role. Isn?t that sweet. It?s the informal role that stinks to high heaven, Doc. The one that helped Hillary Clinton get away with treason and so much more.',fake
'Bill Still received some information overnight that point out the serious character defects or total lack thereof on the part of the Democrat candidate for president. Hillary Clinton exhibited rage towards the moderator at the Commander-in-Chief Forum, Matt Lauer, for doing in one instance what he should have done for the entire thirty minutes, asking her and pressing her on a question that she hadn?t been fed in advance. She was supposed to go out, recite responses that were well rehearsed and wait for Trump to be caught off guard. Instead it was she who got the surprise and that triggered a rage that we?ve rumors of. Now a firsthand accounting of what happened was sent to Bill Still, and he?s sharing it with America.The source of his information originated at a Comcast email address, the parent company of NBC.? It is supposedly from members of the technical crew that worked the event and describes what happened moments after Clinton walked off the set. They described ?a massive profanity-laced tirade? on the part of Clinton that was directed at Matt Lauer in particular, but had moments for others, including DNC Chairperson Donna Brazile.As he learned, Clinton had been given all of the questions in advance but was tripped up by Lauer asking her something she hadn?t been given, throwing her completely off her game and script. The topic was a tricky one for Clinton, her use of an illegal home server for the storing, receiving and transmitting of government secret documents. One of those working the event for Comcast described her as visibly beginning to boil with the asking of that question.Her outburst began immediately after she left the stage, with her first throwing a full glass of water into the face of her assistant, with manic, uncontrolled screaming beginning at that point. The source described Clinton as the ?most foul-mouthed woman I?ve ever heard, and that voice at screech level ? awful.?She also had some racist condescending comments for the black DNC chairman, Brazile, including suggestions that she was better qualified to be the campaign?s janitor.One female NBC executive is quoted as saying that Brazile?s stoic response to the unhinged Clinton only served to enrage her more. She described it saying, ?It was the most awful and terrible?and racist display ? such a profane meltdown I have ever witnessed from anyone, and I will never forget it.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'It?s probably even worse than DHS Secretary Jihadi Jeh Johnson having his crooked fingers wrapped around America?s polling stations and electoral infrastructure, the fact that much of our electronic voting machines and systems are provided by the most visible and arguably the greatest threat to American liberty, George Soros. The wolf isn?t just in the hen house, he?s providing the egg incubators.Joseph Stalin is often quoted as having said, in various forms, ?The people who cast the votes don?t decide an election, the people who count the votes do.? Stalin may not have been the most eloquent speaker but he was a very shrewd guy. Soros is also very shrewd.Smartmatic, is a voting technology company based in Britain that has deep globalist connections. Its CEO is Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, a member of the British House of Lords and a board member of George Soros?s Open Society Foundations. He has also served as the vice-chairman of Soros?s Investment Funds and was a deputy secretary-general of the United Nations under Kofi Annan.Annan was the guy who started Bill Clinton on his career as a high-profile disaster relief profiteer as his Tsunami Czar back in 2005. That?s the same year that Smartmatic bought out California-based Sequoia Voting Systems and gained entry into the US electoral infrastructure. Malloch-Brown has also been a UN World Bank vice-president, member of PM Gordon Brown?s cabinet, and has extensive connections to both Bill and Hillary Clinton as well. It?s unsettling to know that the same, typical network of cronyism and self-serving special interests that is characteristic of the Clintons is so intimately involved with determining if she will be the next president, perhaps more so than the American voters.The Daily Caller reports that Smartmatic controls the voting machines in 16, roughly one third of all states, including the battlegrounds of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. They also oversee machines in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.Small manipulations in critical areas could completely alter the election results, particularly in the already hotly contested battlegrounds. Creating a little credibility by doggedly promoting favorable, and likely false, polls and ignoring crowd sizes would complement the setup for manipulation and a steal.The DC also points out that Smartmatic ran the controversial online balloting for the Utah GOP caucus last March, which was criticized for the inability to secure personal electronic devices that were used to both register and vote. Security doesn?t matter if the results are already predetermined.It seems Soros and company recognize the depraved wisdom of Joseph Stalin.

'It?s not even a matter of sending mixed messages anymore. The Department of Homeland ?Security? under this pretend ?president? and his henchman Secretary, Jihadi Jeh Johnson, is an anti-American mechanism for the breaching of every aspect of the security of our nation.

The award is called the ?Outstanding American by Choice? award, a ridiculous name for an award that creates a mockery of the agency bestowing it.The annual award, presented by the subversives at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is described as an effort to recognize the ?significant contributions and achievements of a naturalized? American citizen. Those achievements don?t have to be in a positive manner, apparently, in the tradition of Time magazine naming Hitler their person of the year, but they should be.Today?s recipient runs a billion dollar charity dedicated to helping illegal aliens skirt the law and remain in the United States. The traitor to this nation, who should instead be having her naturalized status revoked by DHS, is Antonia Hernandez. She?s a ?civil rights? lawyer that litigates on behalf of illegals for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).MALDEF also agitates in favor of free college tuition for illegals and the lowering of educational standards so they can get into and not flunk out of college.? As noted by Judicial Watch, ?The group?s leadership says it?s racist to make English the country?s official national language and inhumane to protect the southern border with a fence.? Aside from the destructive nature of their actions, DHS is embracing the labeling of their agents as brutal racists and commending the labeling of them as such.What in the world is DHS?doing honoring this despicable person who?s loyalty clearly lies with her race and not with the nation who?s laws she is countermanding? Why not find someone who patrols the border on their own time or turned in illegals working in the United States, resulting in their criminal employer being thrown into jail for a few months? There are laws on the books requiring that those actions be taken, but these outlaw officials ignore and demean our laws.?Judicial Watch also makes the point that the award Hernandez is being given is supposedly given to someone who demonstrates ?their commitment to this country and to the common civic values that unite us all as Americans.? The common values of destroying the United States and breaking as many laws as possible do unite a large percentage of Democrats, but far from all Americans. They should have kept looking.Once Mr. Trump is elected, every significant member of this regime as well as those in Congress who empowered and enabled their lawless rampage against this country, should be immediately arrested and prosecuted for treason. The prescribed sentences should then be carried out immediately as per the Constitution.These people are engaging in an attack on our nation. They are the enemy within. They must be treated as such.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Ann Coulter describes ?one of the wonderful things about Donald Trump is this attack on political correctness and it is so much more than specific words. It is the political correctness that teaches Americans that we have the worst culture, we are the most oppressive, we oppress all of these poor, third world hordes pouring into our country, that we?re corrupt and dishonest, when the truth is pretty much exactly the opposite.?She says, ?By and large, Anglo-Saxon Americans, black Americans, the traditional Americans, pre- the third world hordes coming in, are the most honest, the most respectful of women, children, the vulnerable, the elderly, the unborn. So when we?re bringing in immigrants from vastly different cultures, we?re just inevitably bringing in a lot more corruption and a lot more criminality.?The host describes an FBI undercover agent?s visit to a halal market in which he pretended to be a new arrival to the US and then is given assistance in committing every type of fraud imaginable in order to obtain social services, including Social Security Disability fraud.The list of goodies included earned income tax credits in spite of never having worked in the US, lying about not knowing English so that he could be paid to attend school rather than work, Disability, EBT, SNAP and WIC. He notes, ?They?re not coming to the United States to work,? which would be bad enough in displacing American worker, ?they?re coming to the United States to steal. Why would you want to import people like this??Coulter replies that ?Americans have no immunity to these sorts of crimes because by and large your traditional American criminal is dumb, commits obvious crimes, leaves evidence all over, we understand the motive, it?s usually some crap-ass motive about some petty amount. But many other cultures, every single level of society is criminal. So now we?re getting smart criminals coming in, figuring out how to work the system and stealing from Medicare and Medicaid.?She says, ?I mean I?m sorry but Trump is right. We don?t need Paul Ryan cutting back on Social Security and cutting back on Medicare and cutting back on Medicaid. What we need is Donald Trump to stop this dump of low-wage workers and third-world very backward cultures on the country. They?re bringing in their elderly relatives, immediately going on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.?Coulter adds, ?And also, an awful lot of them, more than our native born, are committing massive fraud.? It?s worth noting that as incredible as the numbers and the abuse is at present, Clinton is on the record as wanting to increase Islamic imports by 550\% and legalize anyone who wanders across our border.

'Harmanpreet Kaur created history on Thursday for Indian cricket when she scored an unbeaten 171 runs from 115 balls with 20 fours and seven sixes coming in her rapid fire inning that thumped the Australian attack. The knock gave immense happiness to most Indians, except Bharti, who was an upcoming badminton player. Her parents shifted her to cricket today morning and her dream of becoming a top notch badminton player vanished in a span of ?minutes.Bharti, who is 14 years old, was never into sports as a child. But PV Sindhu?s silver medal at the Olympics changed her life. Her parents admitted her into a badminton academy in Hyderabad with the hope that one day she will also emulate Sindhu. Bharti always dreamed of becoming a doctor, but then who cares about a child?s dream in India. Bharti?s parents were continuously glued to news channels on the day of Sindhu?s victory and learnt that there are some good academies in India. That is when they admitted Bharti into one of them, in the next morning. Though not her area of interest, Bharti had started to take liking for the game and her game was developing pretty well.But Harmanpreet?s magical knock yesterday changed everything. Bharti?s parents heard many neighbors who were discussing about putting their daughters into cricket academies. Then what, a seat at a cricket academy in Hyderabad was booked and Bharti was shifted there overnight. Bharti who has never played cricket before in her life, found it difficult to understand the game, but is giving her best to live her parents?s dream of making her an elite cricketer, only until another female athlete wins something big in some other sport.In fact no of academies giving coaching to budding female talent has increased overnight and that is not such a great news for Badminton.',fake
'Groping: The house of cards that is the multiple coordinated lies and smears of the mainstream media in support of Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump is starting to list to one side, First a witness showed up who remembered the groping encounter from the 80s stating there was no kissing or any other type of physical interaction, in spite of Ms. Leeds? best efforts to initiate one.Now considerable doubt has been cast upon the unsubstantiated assertions of Summer Zervos, who claimed that Mr. Trump was groping?and kissed her in a hotel during a 2007 interview. Mr. Trump contends strongly that no meeting ever took place and revelations by a family member now seem to support his position. Ms. Zervos looks more like she had her feelings hurt over Trumps lack of attention in her than her sensibilities hurt by his excess interest.Zervos? cousin, John Barry of Mission Viejo, CA, said he believes Zervos is acting vindictively. He issued a statement saying, ?I am completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin, Summer Zervos, and her press conference today. Ever since she was on The Apprentice she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump.?He said that Zervos often described Mr. Trump as an inspiration to her professionally and that she had ?converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters.? He pinpoints the time things changed as coinciding with his rejecting her request to visit her restaurant. He said, ?That was until Summer invited Mr. Trump to her restaurant during the primary and he said no. I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she?s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump.?He added, ?That?s not how she talked about him before. I can only imagine that Summer?s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump?s expense, and I don?t think it reflects well.?The Trump campaign also released a copy of an email Zervos sent to Mr. Trump?s secretary in April of this year in which she is attempting to contact him in hopes of reconnecting, noting how popular he is in her area of California and stating that her ?intentions are genuine.? ??Genuine intentions also come in a nuthouse crazy, extra crazy and a genuine gold-digger variety, which seem like the categories she fits into. Genuine celebrity stalker is a possibility as well. She?s not believable and she?s really not that good of an actress. As a salesperson she was unimpressive, failing to sell the whole he groped me narrative. Her hand to her chest, catching her breath and other momentary displays of dealing with her ?raw victim hood emotions? were overdone. Has she tried singing or dancing?The letter she sent to Trump?s office on April 21st has the appearance of the reactions of a jilted and disappointed woman who had delusions of something that didn?t exist and had no chance of existing. Having come to that realization and feeling spurned, a setup letter with an offer to ?clear the air? and the prospect of later acting upon it, on behalf of his opponents is quite possible. Trump didn?t take the bait but they rolled out a version of the operation anyway. Progressives plan things in great detail, well in advance. We?d be naive to think that this type of attack wouldn?t be planned and implemented, ready for roll out if necessary.In launching her initial attack, Zervos said, ?I contacted his secretary in April of 2016 and asked if I could reconnect with Mr. Trump. I did not tell her why I wanted to speak with him. She responded that perhaps his campaign team would follow up with me. I then wrote his assistant an email on April 21, 2016, asking her to send my email directly to Mr. Trump.That would be the setup, plan B, since he didn?t take the bait on the first attempt. She said, ?In that email, I stated, ?Your interest in me as a potential employee meant the world to me. Your interest in me as anything more blew my mind, and I lost my footing.? I further said, ?I have been incredibly hurt by our previous interaction.? I ended by stating, ?I hope to hear from you and wish you continued success.? Mr. Trump did not reply.?Trump issued a statement earlier stating that he vaguely remembered Zervos from when she was on ?The Apprentice,? but they never met at a hotel. He said, ?That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I?ve conducted my life.? He accused the media of creating a ?theater of absurdity.?No one really cares outside of the Clinton media if Trump kissed a woman who came to his hotel room. She went there of her own accord and whatever happened there was between them. No criminal complaint was filed and her behavior indicated that nothing happened. If she?s the big girl she presented herself as on the television show she?d have done a much better job of selling the news conference and also would have an idea of what happens in hotel rooms. Whether she actually visited him or not is irrelevant.We?ve got a country to save; let?s move on.

'Former Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino is interviewed regarding the information that is leaking out about the violations of protocol, both generally, diplomatically and in matters related to security by Hillary Clinton, particularly as it relates to the Secret Service.The conversation began with Martha MacCallum noting that there are now revelations that a former Secret Service agent of Bill Clinton?s worked as one of Hillary Clinton?s illegal bootleg server IT guys. That?s an interesting arrangement since he was certainly aware that what he was doing was illegal.\r\nDan Bongino says that he?s been told may agents on the inside that are sources for him that they view Hillary Clinton as a ?very unique threat to our republic,? and that is the motivation for many of the whistleblowers who are now coming forward.He says that it is because of the threat that she poses that their Omerta, the code of silence is now not being observed to the degree it has been previously. He says, ?And this story about an agent being used to assist with Clinton Foundation server issues, security issues, which is totally against the rules for the Secret Service, I?m pretty confident I know who the agent is, is totally unsurprising to me. And I?ll bet there?s a lot more there that?s not being said, I?m reasonably confident of that as well, based upon some stories I?ve heard about what actually happened over there.?They raise the issue revealed in released FBI documents, a complaint that Clinton would boot her security detail and diplomats she was meeting with from her limousine in order to make room for Huma Abedin. The report stated, ?This frequently resulted in complaints by ambassadors who were insulted and embarrassed by this breach of protocol.? It stated that one individual, whose name was redacted, explained, ?Clinton?s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere.?Dan Bongino points out that this is relative for several reasons, including the fact that it ?fits in with the larger narrative of Hillary Clinton. Her elitist snob attitude towards the military and towards her Secret Service agents, which was pretty pervasive during my time with her, it? parlays into this elitist attitude towards government too that the rules don?t apply to her.?Mr. Bongino describes the incident that she just described as ?a major slap in the face.? He elaborates, saying, ?They have a protocol chief in the State Department who strictly handles things like this. This is a major embarrassment on a foreign trip for her not to do this and to be seen separated in the motorcade from the leader of the country she?s been invited to.??But Martha again,? Bongino reminds his host, ?she?s an elitist, she acts like a snob, she treats people terribly, and she doesn?t care about your feelings, or frankly, any protocol rules the government has. It doesn?t matter. It?s all about Mrs. Clinton all the time. She doesn?t care. And she treated female agents terribly too, which I find ironic because she says there?s a war on women, yeah there was a war on women in the Secret Service, she waged it. She was really terrible and I guarantee you there will be more people starting to talk about it.?McCallum bails Clinton out, saying, ?Wow, strong charges across the board and I know that you have personal experience to back up your opinion, here.? He?s asked about the feelings of agents about potentially having to protect her again. Bongino says, ?Martha, there are agents and uniformed division officers that are deathly afraid of this woman.?He says, ?This woman has to be kept out of the White House. She views government as a tool for her own personal ambitions, that is it.

'Any time Hillary Clinton gets behind a podium and starts to speak, something weird happens. ?She takes on this faraway look like she?s listening to a conversation somewhere else, gets distracted and then starts to say things that make absolutely no sense.During 2016 presidential election debate three at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, she had yet another of these episodes that invites all sorts of conspiracy theory like speculation. ?Not having watched the debate, the question could have been on anything from terrorism to gun control, but it was clear she was talking about the night club shooting in Orlando, Florida.And here you thought I was going to tell you all about how treasonous it was to reveal the time from order to launch of nuclear missiles. ?That?s for another post.The poster of the video, Matt Naugle, added the sound effects of the warped voice, but the point is clear: her thoughts on the matter were either not coherent, or she was waiting for what she should say from another source. ?From all reports, viewers were watching for tell tail signs of cheating. ?Everything from a teleprompter in the podium to an earpiece has been discussed to death on the comment boards. ?All regular joe types think she was stilted and over-prepared to the point of having known the answers ahead of time.This clip, though, is the only true trainwreck where even someone who didn?t watch the whole ?debate? beginning to end can tell there was an ?oh, $#@!? moment that had to be covered to surface. ?Yet. ?There will be more coming, no doubt, like this one where all appearances that Hillary dropped an f-bomb are clear to those looking for it.Put these clips against the ?upward spiral? bit where Hillary?s train of thought obviously derailed, the two or three most prominent seizure moments, and the weird facial contortions at the convention, and something is really not right. ?The Democrats can deny it all they want, but, really, that little bit was a sign that all is not what it seems.',fake
'Anonymous has the goods on the Democrats, we know it has to be Democrats because they?re the crooked ones, stuffing ballots in multiple states. We?ve expected they were going to try to steal the election, in fact, it?s the only way they can take the White House. Now we?ve got proof and it?s time to invalidate the early voting in all states until we can get some real controls in place.There seem to be primarily employees or volunteers working to circumvent the system, with one or multiple blockers being used in most of the instances. It?s the same style of stacks of ballots being stuffed into the boxes being utilized in each situation. They paid attention in their Democrat workshops. This is not a cluster of individual random acts. This is obviously coordinated.In Illinois it?s two women, one blocker and one stuffer. In the next location, the first of two in Pennsylvania, the stuffer is wearing what appears to be a name badge and appears to be at a work station. That?s an apparent indicator that she and blocker, who also has on a name badge, are working or volunteering at the polling place. ?In the second Pennsylvania location, three individuals, again appearing to be employees or officials, block the view of the ballot box as a fourth woman?loads it up with Clinton ballots. Nobody else is paying any attention; maybe it happens so often it?s no longer noteworthy.In what Anonymous?labeled as the worst incident of the video, four persons take turns stuffing boxes as fast as they can. All of these women, apparently doing their part to get that big Hillary crack into the glass ceiling at the White House, are guilty of serious crimes. They should be immediately arrested, interrogated and made to spill their guts as to who coordinated these efforts and put them up to it. If they don?t want to talk, send them away for a long time. They can share a cell or at least be in the same cell block with Hillary Clinton.We know where the word to commit these criminal acts originates, at the top of the criminal Democrat Party. Maybe all fifty?states and territories can just go back to the same day voting for everyone for this election since the Democrats have completely destroyed the integrity of this system. It is not being protected and the counts cannot be trusted as legitimate, in fact, they are guaranteed to be illegitimate. Clearly their intent is to repeat these criminal acts in as many locations as many times as possible, over and over, every day until the election.UPDATE ? We?ve received a possible temporary injection of relief into the mix, information is coming in that at least one?of these incidents may have taken place in Russia. That?s good, if it?s true, but it is by no means a reason for us to relax. Just as is verified by the New York City Election Commissioner, election fraud is rampant and happening all the time. It is built into the system. What is happening in the video, regardless of where it is taking place, is exactly the type of systemic abuse, be it electronic or paper balloting, that we have to be guarding against. It is what the Democrats plan to subject us to. Just because these instances may have occurred elsewhere does not mean they are not happening here as well; they are. The ability to commit this type of election fraud was the motivation behind the criminal leadership at DHS wanting access to polling stations across the nation.?They know the only way they can win is through cheating. Americans don?t want another criminal for president. We had better be ready to fight this and engaged, or the election will, without a doubt, be stolen and the nation destroyed.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'George Will, your time is past. ?Your methods of madness are over. ?You may be able to write eloquently with words some of us wish were in our vocabularies, but with your recent comments, you have proven to red blooded Americans now known among ourselves as ?deplorables? that you are a racist, elitist snob who has no idea what we out on the fruited plain face every day. ?Furthermore, your stated intention to shape American conservatism in the mold it has occupied for the last few decades shows just how out of touch you really are.You see, Mr. Will, the economic policies you and your fellow ?conservative? inhabitants of inside the beltway, i.e. The Swamp, have been pressing on the American people DO NOT WORK. ?The whole ?free trade? thing ? lowering the trade barriers without other countries lowering theirs ? basically turns the USA into a flea market for cheap crap from overseas, not the quality goods that our own factories used to produce which kept our money circulating within the country. ?Not only that, but NOT building a wall and securing our borders leaves the whole place open to invasion from all directions. ?The illegal immigrant stream of the past few years via the desert of the southwest proves that there are still people willing to risk death to come here.In addition, the middle class is dying under a confiscatory tax scheme ? including Obamacare which needs to die in a bad way ? and you, Mr. Will, and your fellow ?conservatives? inside the beltway just don?t see it. ?No, what you see is a nation of people not as one, but multiple different groups that can and should be pigeonholed for political gain. ?Please, don?t deny this. ?This concept was more than obvious in an interview with Brit Hume on Thursday evening. ?It is in the second half of the comments in the video below, but the idea that the Trump camp of Republicans are looking JUST to expand white voters is absurd on its face. ?The people attending his rallies are from every walk of life, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian. ?We are ALL suffering under the current system. (Some of the statements he makes here are outright willful denial.)Tone and substance? ?Mr. Will, your tone is pedantic and insulting to the people who actually are struggling to make a living under the current regime that panty waists like you refuse to call out in plain, everyday language. ?One thing in your rhetoric that is VERY wrong, is that the American people ARE ANGRY, not bewildered, not confused. ?And we are not just angry, we are PISSED OFF that we have been used and abused by the power hungry and greedy for their gain without us having a say. ?Soft spoken strong words do NOTHING to change that. ?We the American people far prefer a take charge alpha male who says what he thinks and can get the job done. ?It is a skill set that is an anathema to the talking heads of Washington. (All George Will knows how to do is talk using pretty words. ?His calluses come from a typewriter, not a shovel. He was born into a family of professors.)As for entitlements and increased tax revenue, it is counter-intuitive to theorists, but Ronald Reagan ? a candidate and president George Will opposed ? proved that LOWER taxes INCREASE REVENUES, both personal and tax, that will alleviate the deficit and eventually lead to lower entitlements as the middle and lower classes accumulate wealth and no longer need them. ?Tariffs ? eliminated in the U.S., anyway, by free trade ? are yes, a tax, but they are the tax that makes products made in the USA, by Americans, competitive in the marketplace. ?Those of us who are hand-crafters know that a handmade baby beanie, realistically, will never sell at its actual price of materials plus labor. ?Not when new moms can go to Walmart and get something comparable for a third of the cost thanks to no tariff.(Sorry, but this math is not that hard, and humans throughout history have always understood economics at its most basic level without academic ?experts? having to explain it.)This is a lesson in real life that inside the beltway ?conservatives? refuse to learn. ?It?s as if they want to be the perpetual underdog rather than actually putting the ideals they push into practice. ?And that includes George Will. ?The movement of conservatism is not nearly as neatly groomed and purist as the inside the beltway over educated ?conservatives? want it to be. ?The concepts and recognition of the smarminess of the opposition gained force thanks to a variety of information vehicles, which makes this statement featured this week on Rush Limbaugh?s show all the more egregious:WILL:? It depends partly on the size of Mr. Trump?s defeat.? If it?s a narrow defeat, that?s the worst (snickers) conceivable outcome for Republicans, because then it will be the old stab-in-the-back theory, that but for people like Paul Ryan or Ben Sasse or lesser figures like George Will, all would have been well.? Mrs. Clinton may win by four points, but well over 300 electoral votes. That would help the Republicans.? The Republican Party has to do several things.? First, it has to somehow emancipate itself from its thralldom to the indignation industry of talk radio and certain cable personalities that I think have a paralyzing effect on the party when it tries to deal with things like immigration.? Until the Republican Party gets right with minorities in this country, it?s never gonna win another presidential election.The caller who followed this segment of Rush?s show hit the nail on the head:CALLER:? Years ago, decades ago, George Will did not initially support Ronald Reagan.? And he, like so many elites, don?t understand that you don?t tell us what to think; you share what we think, and we appreciate you because you express it so eloquently, and you allow us all to know that there?s millions like us.? And another thing they don?t get is you respect us.? And that?s something that Trump and Pence do.? They respect us. They?re reaching out to people while Hillary?s calling us a bunch of deplorables, and it?s a very poor reflection on George Will and elites like John Kasich and others that they support through their words and actions.And THAT is what we deplorables recognize is the issue with George Will and the other elitist, racist snobs. ?They do not respect the people that they need to keep them in power. ?They do not respect our opinions, work methods or places. ?They do not know what it means to have to work sixty hours a week to make ends meet, and if they do, it may well be due to lifestyle. ?Most of them don?t work on their feet unless they have a standing desk.This rant could go on and on about how much of a snob George Will and the rest of the ?conservative? elite are, but the exercise would be pointless. ?As a deplorable, regardless of a college degree from a ?Top 25? institution and experience in the arts worth another, this writer?s opinion is moot to the self-described gatekeepers of ?conservatism.? ?Why? ?Because it stands at odds with the conservatism of the past that the guards are desperately trying to keep alive despite the American people moving on from it. ?The racist pigeonholing and breaking Americans down into subgroups does not exist with deplorables. ?Nothing matters other than changing laws to put Americans first and to stop the bankrupting of the people. ?No, we do not have the same lifestyles, or tastes, but that doesn?t matter. ?We have the same goals.',fake

'James O?Keefe?s Project Veritas has really done it this time. Their undercover reporting is exposing the malicious attacks on our electoral system that are a massive web of criminality employed on a daily basis targeting the American people and our rights to choose our leaders. It?s business as usual for the Democrat Party.They have revealed a sophisticated covert voter and election fraud operation that is being run illegally and immorally all across this nation by the corrupt Democrats. The security breaches that Obama, Clinton and the Democrats were ?so concerned about,? the ones supposedly originating with the Russians, pale in comparison to what they are themselves doing to corrupt the electoral process.\r\nThe hacks on the DNC and Clinton are a?revelation of what they were actually doing. If it?s wrong they?re responsible, don?t nuke the messenger?or use it as a premise for World War lll.?Excuse us if we don?t get too upset that treason by our pretend ?president? and his henchmen were exposed by someone. What is important is that the truth gets out, not so much who leaked it. The corruption that threatens America was in the acts of the Democrats, not in those who obtained the data. It is the Democrats who are?attacking the sanctity of our electoral process.Hacks that exposed what the Democrats were already doing are nothing compared to what Project Veritas reveals here. The assaults, abuse of the process, voter intimidation, violations of the law and mass voter fraud that the Democrats are engaged in?are breathtaking.?They revel in being the thugs and goons, paid by George Soros with full knowledge and approval of Obama, Clinton and the rest of the Democrat leadership, who beat up innocent people attending Trump rallies. They commit identity theft, enabling multiple voting and other illegal voting. They are criminals and the organization is corrupt, top to bottom, through and through.This second video picks up where the first one left off yesterday, exposing the blatant criminality that is the Democrat Party. It will be interesting to listen for any faint rustling of a response from the media, to hear any calls for investigations into civil rights violations from the crooked cesspool that is the?Department of Justice. Will either Loretta Lynch or her ACLU bulldog Vanita Gupta, now her civil rights left hand, be launching an investigation? Perhaps, a phony one, the kind that Hillary Clinton received.They will undoubtedly try to sweep this lawlessness under the same carpet with the stack of Clinton violations that they, along with FBI Director Comey, are insulating from public scrutiny. This is no surprise to most of us but it?s a great thing to have it being exposed in this manner.How much more proof do voters need to see before they understand that our government has been hijacked by criminals and that Hillary Clinton and Hussein Obama are perhaps the biggest mobsters ever to walk, slither or shuffle across the face of the earth.As one of their operatives says in the video, ?they?ve been doing it for fifty years.? That?s long enough, it has to stop. Ever heard of RICO, Madam Attorney General? This is what it was enacted for ? organized crime, like yours.Updated information: A Tweet from James O?Keefe indicates he?s gotten his second scalp in as many days with the thug Bob Creamer, infamously depicted in the video, now announcing he?s leaving the campaign. He claims he hasn?t done anything wrong, of course, he?s being fired for a reason. It?s not because he?s a criminal, that was why he was hired.

'Lou Dobbs describes the current campaign as the dirtiest in memory and his memory goes back all the way to 1976. That was the year a misguided public voted Jimmy Carter into office. He represented a leader whose primary ?qualification? was his ?pure heart,? although he was an early member of the globalist Trilateral Commission. It was a well kept secret and they were virtually unknown. It?s difficult to describe Jimmy Carter by using the ?L? word, better just to call him a president.Against the backdrop of that election, Dobbs points out that more goes into the election of a president than reason and good sense in the support of our national interest. Now with 26 days remaining until the election Dobbs describes the unusual clarity about the candidates in this election, more so than in any other contest he recalls.Dobbs says, ?The left wing national media, owned lock, stock and barrel by corporatists and all sorts of establishment elites, have decided in this election at least, to this point, nothing so much needs protection as their own moneyed interests and the stagnant swamp to which most Americans are consigned. That swamp of course our society and our economy. That swamp generally referred to as the status quo because the elites think that sounds a heck of a lot better than ?stagnant swamp.\'??But one candidate has managed to set himself apart,? says Dobbs, ?running against the status quo, against the establishment, trying to drain that swamp and run the elites out of town. Trump had the courage to take on the establishment, the elites of both parties, the national media and fight like hell for the middle class working men and women and their families.?Dobbs says, ?He is not only ringed by his powerful adversaries now in the final month of this contest but he has been betrayed by his miserable allies, the leaders of the Republican Party. This is a battle that can still be won by the American people and no one else.?Dobbs adds, ?And if this republic is lost, we will have ourselves only to blame.?Please like Rick on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/ and at Stop The Takeover, https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/ and please follow on Twitter @RickRWells I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Lou Dobbs has a few thoughts on the topic of the national liberal media ignoring the Clinton Cartel?s vast web of corruption in Washington DC. He notes, ?Fortunately for all of us the Wall Street Journal is still in the news business and today we learned that top Clinton ally, Governor Terry McAuliffe, gave $467,000 in campaign contributions to the wife of an FBI official who was among those who began leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton?s email scandal.??McAuliffe met with Dr. Jill McCabe,? Dobbs says, ?in March 2015 to encourage her to run for the Virginia State Senate, the same month the Clinton email scandal emerged.? Dobbs describes it as ?Purely coincidental, I?m sure, and I?m sure the Clintons have more coincidences in their lives than any hundred married couples anywhere in the world.??The lives and work of the Clintons and Governor McAuliffe,? says Dobbs, ?have intersected throughout the last three decades. McAuliffe authored the infamous Lincoln Bedroom memo back in 1995. A straight tradeoff offering White House access to top donors. A quid pro quo scheme that raised a lot of money. Governor McAuliffe guaranteed the mortgage on the Clinton?s Chappaqua home. He did that back in 1999. He launched an electric car company, Green Tech before he was elected governor. The company was granted special access in securing visas by the federal government.?Dobbs points out, ?McAuliffe even received help from a firm run by Tony Rodham. That?s right, Hillary?s brother, who obtained foreign investors and visas. Of course the Governor himself is the subject of an FBI investigation now, over campaign contributions from a Chinese businessman who is a former delegate to China?s parliament and has permanent US resident status. How about that???His name is Weng Wenliang,? says Dobbs, ?He gave $120,000 to McAuliffe?s 2013 campaign and, oh yes, he didn?t forget about the Clinton Foundation, $2 million dollars to the Foundation. In fact, 120 Clinton Foundation donors also contributed more than $13 million dollars to Governor McAuliffe?s campaigns. There?s the Clinton Foundation again; purely coincidental, I acknowledge.?Dobbs adds, ?And it?s purely coincidental that Dr. Jill McCabe?s husband is now the number two man at the FBI, reporting to Director James Comey. Purely coincidence again.?',fake
'Lou Dobbs focuses on the prominent role the month of March has played in the Clinton email and other scandals. He calls it ?The troublesome ides of March, especially March of last year. For a number of reasons that month has proven to be pivotal in the scandal over her use of a ?private? server to conduct official State Department business, communicating by email over that server.?\r\nHe points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business.?\r\n\r\nIn an interview Obama was asked, ?Mr. ?president,? when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State?? Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, ?The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.?\r\nMr. Dobbs points out the fact that ?Everybody else, however, didn?t believe the ?president? when he said that. And Clinton?s top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, ?We need to clean this up,? noting the ?president? has emails from Hillary that do not say ?State.gov.\'?\r\n\r\nDobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena.?\r\nMarch was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated $467,000 to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton ?investigation.?\r\nDobbs closes, saying, ?As I have always said, there are no coincidences when it comes to the Clintons, and these latest revelations show how far their corruption extends within our government in Washington DC.\r\n\r\nPlease like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHow Many People Visit                                        \r\n \r\nComments He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of 2015, with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since.

'Since Donald Trump took the gloves off the liberal elites have opted to employ their own new strategy of naked betrayal. Dobbs notes the difficulty that the elites are having with Trump, now recognizing that he is truly a threat to their status quo cronyism to a much greater degree than they had earlier been willing to believe.Noting that Trump made his fortune before entering into politics rather than as a result of it, and the threat that he presents, he?s ?far too close for further laxity among the elites. They are taking him now seriously, so seriously they mean to seriously kill his candidacy outright. And that?s why Donald Trump is fighting an all but impossible to win war on three fronts.?Dobbs describes how Speaker Paul Ryan, ?Today chose to betray millions of Trump voters and supporters, abandon any common sense it seems he might possess, and turn his back on his party?s presidential nominee. Ryan telling House Republicans that he will not defend nor campaign with Trump, telling lawmakers to ?do what?s best for you in your district.??Not only is Ryan?s behavior puerile and selfish, we?re getting kind of use to that, his intellect betrays him on the occasions that he does try to employ it.? Dobbs says, ?He seems hellbound to destroy the Republican Party, Trump?s candidacy and now the majority in the House. Ryan appears to have absolutely no concept of the power of unity, his responsibility as Speaker, the institutional importance of his party and duty to the nation.??He is a laughing stock leader,? says Dobbs, ?a small man dressed up in a big job, capable of only the dreariest clich?s and the forlorn looks of earnest mediocrity to which he can seldom rise. At least forty Republicans in Congress have denounced Trump now. Oh, I?m sure Donald Trump tonight is shaken as they pull their support or ask him to step aside after his hot mic comments from eleven years ago.?Dobbs describes the duplicitous politicians as being led by the treasonous Ryan from sure victories in the House, and likely the Senate and White House to possible defeat, sanctimony and cowardice. Their constituents, he says, ?should be voting them out of office. And Ryan should no more be the Speaker of the House than Hillary Clinton should be president of the United States. And make no mistake, the futures of those two are intertwined.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'General Dogla Karamati, Chief? of ISI or Invertebrate Services Incorporated was sitting in his plush chamber guzzling wine and chewing on cherries when his deputy Pareshaan Harkat entered.?General Sir, Burhan Bunny has been killed by the Indian Security forces.?The General who had been watching a video of ?Sunny Leone tore his eyes from the TV and snapped. ?Who the jahannum is Bunny???Don?t you remember Sir? he was among the latest batch of recruits trained by us and sent to India-Occupied-Pakistan or IOP to unleash mayhem.??Come on, how do you expect me remember one individual. Over the last two decades, our militant organisations have been mentoring and releasing thousands of would be martyrs in IOP.??But sir, this boy was special.??Why???In the practical exam he had topped among more than 1000 competitors, and you yourself had given him a special medal ?Jalladey Pakistan!??What kind of exam was that???For each of the contestants we had put one Baluchi on the starting line, and asked the prey to crawl a distance of 25 meters. Each participant had to fire 5 shots standing at the finishing line ? the first shot was? to dismember the left hand of the quarry,? the second the right hand, the third and fourth the knees and the last bullet was to land between the eyes. The earlier one could complete the task the more number of points he got. Bunny got his Balcuchi in all the right spots within five meters of the starting line. No other contestant could manage a perfect score even after their respective Baluchis had wriggled the entire distance.??Oh, Yes! Now I remember, brilliant fellow!??What now Sir ???Let us capitalize on Bunny?s death. It is an ?Osama? sent opportunity. Ask our twin-brothers in arms in IOP to whip up a frenzy. Direct our experts to create a viral tsunami on the social media.? Let our activists in IOP get the young and restless out on the streets in support of Bunny. Our boys should simply foment unrest and then disappear and leave the dying to the Indians. And make sure the international media gets a ring side view of the happenings.??That should not be a problem, Sir. We have the entire mechanism in place.

One who loses his right or left leg is given 2 lakhs. The family of a martyr gets Rs. 10 lakhs.??Abey Khachhar! Didn?t I tell you to add an incentive for the deaths caused???Sorry Sir! I was just coming to that. For every person killed by him, our suicide bomber will get Rs. 10,000/-.??Good!

'VARANASI:??On his first visit to Varanasi after his party?s over sized victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will head back to his parliamentary constituency today. Though it is a big occasion for PM Modi, it has created havoc in the election commission office. Most of the officers are checking if there is an election anytime soon in Varanasi and whether they have missed out marking the dates in their calendar.PM Modi, 67, had camped for three days in the holy city in March that helped give the BJP 312 of the 403 seats, the biggest majority for any party in Uttar Pradesh since 1977.But after March this is the first visit by the PM, which makes people think that he only visits during election time. People in Varanasi were seen asking each other if there is any election planned for the up coming days. PMO has installed posters at every corner of the city assuring that there is no election in the upcoming days and PM?s visit is only for inaugurating many infrastructure projects in the pious town. Modi Ji has promised that he will not talk about his achievements in the past 3 years and will not ask for votes for which people were afraid of.Yogi Adityanath has ordered the civic work department to carry out major cleanliness drive for the PM?s visit. He is even sure that just like the PM did in Gujarat, he may announce some big initiatives for U.P, something on the lines of Metro, or river front or a big factory. PMO has also kept its ears wide open about any new announcement of the PM in Varanasi as they are the ones who have to implement what the PM promises in his constituency.',fake
'Election fraud in the United States is a fact of life. The mainstream media may deny it, and claim that no case has ever been proven, but eyewitness accounts tell us that this is the case. ?Not only that, but more then one election had an outcome that so differed from empirical rally and enthusiasm evidence, that claims of candidates being robbed are considered to be probable, but unprovable. ?Until now.In a year that has given us one leak and undercover video after another exposing collusion in media messaging between one major political party and those who disseminate information, yet another brave American by the name of Bev Harris tried her darndest to go undercover and bring Americans a view of what happens behind the scenes at election headquarters in various counties, specifically in Tennessee. ?Bottom line: cameras are NOT ALLOWED in where computers that count the votes are kept. ?Public access to the process is strictly controlled leaving all sorts of room for election fraud as there are no neutral eyes on the counting.To make matters more obscene, the software that came with all the newfangled voting machines has now gone commercial. ?Harris?s website, Black Box Voting, has a good explanation, but for a demonstration, check out this video. ?Yes, it?s long, but the viewer can watch how votes can be manipulated in real time.For those out there who thought that every vote is counted?sorry to disappoint, but it looks like election fraud is starting to be mainstreamed with computers and a simple percentage formula like one would make up for an Excel spreadsheet. ?Considering the number of states where this software is used?look out.This video, showing that the manipulation can be at the precinct level, does lend credence to something Karl Rove and other professional politicos have to say: it only takes a handful of precincts to flip an election. ?The fraction action is done by precinct. ?Just like election returns are reported. ?(Can you say RIGGED?)If ever there was a demonstration of why we should be using paper ballots and they should be counted in full view of the public and live streamed to constituents, this is it. ?Losing an election is palatable if the count is honest. ?This level of election fraud, on the other hand, is beyond maddening.Additional analysis from Alex Jones available here.',fake

'According to sources, Republic TV has become a new addiction among people. Its 24 hours Exclusive news is not allowing anyone to leave their seat. Mr. Chandan, who works as a content writer in Buzzpoop, had taken a week?s leave when Republic was aired for the first time. He has now asked his office canteen in-charge to resign after he refused to play Republic TV during lunch hours.Faking News reporter spoke to Chandan, who said, ?Republic has done what no other channel has ever done; it shows Exclusive news even at?midnight. The fearless attack on opposition has never been done by anyone else. All other news channels target only the incumbent government. I had an altercation with my office canteen in charge and I have no regrets. I have learned debating skills from Arnab and I am glad that I got the chance to use them.?It?s not even a month and Arnab?s Republic TV has gained maximum TRP. BARC data shows that Republic TV has captured 52\% market share in just a week?s time.?Journalist-turned-boxer, Rajdeep Sardesai has called BARC sold out. Arnab took a jibe at Sardesai and called his statement an irony. Arnab later conducted a prime time debate on Rajdeep Sardesai?s statement ?BARC sold out? with 30 panelists. Hashtag for the debate was #RajdeepAuctionedCM Arvind Kejriwal has also accused Arnab for tempering with the BARC Data. Kejriwal questioned, ?A few days back NDTV allegedly claimed to have the highest TRP among all the news channels then how come Republic TV became the number 1 channel??What Chandan has demanded is certainly not correct, but ?allegedly? sold out news media houses have certainly raised a valid question.

The channel used to supply direct customers (ethically referred to as patients) from the studios and indirect customers from across the country, watching the channel. Some of us even kept our clinics open in the night, due to the customers seeking our help, immediately after the news hour debates in the night,? the Secretary told Faking News.?As an association, we are never interested in who gets exposed in the channel. On the launch day, Lalu got exposed by REPUBLIC TV. We cared the least. What we are interesting in is about the number of potential patients who are voluntarily exposed to the harmful decibel levels broadcasted across the nation. In fact, we started measuring the decibel levels with reference to the units of TV channel names,? he confirmed.?With the launch of REPUBLIC, a new unit for sound is approved by our association. The unit is named after the new channel and will be known as Republic. Don?t be alarmed when a diagnosis sheet talks about a patient affected with 1 Republic or 1 and 1/2 Republic or 2 Republics,? the Secretary repeated the word so many times much like the news channel repeating the same words over and over again during the debates.?We don?t know if the nation wants to know or even cares to know. We, in fact, have a secret partnership with the news channel. Look at the symbol of the new channel! Almost looks like a doctor?s prescription pad symbol is it not?? the Secretary casually exposed the secret deals between the news channel and the ENT society.',fake
'This is exactly the next step we?ve expected from the Climate Nazis, forced austerity that destroys America?s standard of living and world status. They seem to be firm in the belief that the global government elites will prevail in the upcoming election, by hook or more likely by crook, and they will have four or eight more years to complete the destruction of our nation.Whatever possesses the demonic little unisex tyrant to believe that she somehow has a right and the power to dictate to ?free? Americans their compliance in their own destruction is beyond reason, but she?s doing it. She?s telling some pajama supporter her propaganda as if his agreement with her green authoritarianism somehow makes it legitimate; it?s not. The forces of anti-American destruction embodied by Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton are not our masters regardless of the excuse or false religion, such as air and dirt worship, that they attempt to use to manipulate us into compliance. That appears to be a fact that will increasingly have to be demonstrated to that for them to understand that they are not our masters; so be it.This disgusting little he-she attempts to psychoanalyze the American people as a tool of persuasion, saying, ?People don?t react well when they?re afraid, they tend to think they can?t do anything.? There is nothing about you, you evil little witch, that should inspire any emotion other than disgust, anger, and an appropriate response grounded in the extreme desire to stop you. Only a useless cyber-dork like the human pimple interviewer would find trash like Gina McCarthy or those she serves something to be afraid of. She needs to fear the American people who have had all of this tyranny we?re going to take.The Butch hag says, ?And climate will have to not just be what government does but it has to be what people do.? No, Climate is what God does, what the planet does, it is neither what people or the collection of people known as government do. That is the reality whether it be a national government or a corrupt and illegitimate global one. Climate hoax is also not something that the people do voluntarily, it is the result of distortion and manipulation. It is something that is forced upon them by an exploitative cabal of criminal operatives, such as McCarthy, when they are sufficiently complacent to allow themselves to be bullied into submission.\r\nIn attempting to persuade those who choose to live primitive, deprived lives in service to the climate change religion, in imposing their beliefs legislatively or by dictate upon the rest of us, McCarthy says, ?Individual choices will matter.? Of course she means that only from the standpoint of those who choose obedience to the climate change theology. She adds, ?Consumers can make demands. They have always done that and changed markets as a result of it.?\r\nIn instructing us to accept their austerity mandates, McCarthy says, ?So people have to start living a life that?s commensurate with reductions in greenhouse gases to the extent they can.? She then seeks to bolster her illegitimate authority, saying, ?But as you said, demand government to be responsive to this.? That is, tell government that we agree that we must obey unconstitutional globalist dictates. Her perception of ?responsive government? is one that dictates submission to its ignorant peasants.\r\nHaving recognized that those who have figured out her lies are not going to be manipulated into obedience to her trickery, the little green Nazi demeans those who aren?t led by the nose as does the swollen basement dweller she?s using to promote her propaganda. McCarthy dismisses the self-thinkers saying, ?But I would waste no time with ?climate deniers.? If they haven?t figured out by now, what in God?s name can anyone say to them that would make them figure it out? The science is overwhelming. I don?t check out flat earth society and I?m not talking to climate deniers, that?s it.?\r\n\r\nJust as Obama declared the ?science settled? because the facts don?t match up with his declarations, McCarthy has also lost the argument.

'Erik Prince, former Navy SEAL and founder of Blackwater, was a guest of Breitbart News Daily on Sirius FM radio Friday. ?In his interview, he and host Alex Marlow started talking about the legal mess that Democratic Candidate for president, Hillary Clinton, finds herself in in relation to the hundreds of thousands of emails found on former Congressman Anthony Weiner?s laptop, and Prince dropped a bombshell:?according to one of his ?well-placed sources? in the New York Police Department, ?The NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making? in the Anthony Weiner investigation, but received ?huge pushback? from the Justice Department.Prince then went on to elaborate on what his sources tell him is going on behind the scenes.?Because of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,? Prince claimed.?They found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,? he said.?The amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ?We?re going to go public with this if you don?t reopen the investigation and you don?t do the right thing with timely indictments,?? Prince explained.?I believe ? I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ? the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they?ve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That?s the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,? Prince said.The full interview, available at Breitbart, goes into further detail about the entire affair including that New York Mayor Bill De Blasio wants to distance himself from the entire thing, and that Hillary Clinton and her aides are under investigation by multiple offices in the FBI. ?The New York Police Department, at this time, still apparently has a copy of the Weiner notebook computer files. ?However, it is not the FBI doing the obstructing, it is the Justice Department.That tidbit of information is quite telling.',fake
'New Delhi:?A research study conducted by a leading institute has revealed that even the cows in the country are fed up of the non-stop cow and beef stories in the media for the past 3 years. Cow has become an integral part of Indian politics ever since BJP led NDA came to power in May 2014. Indian media, as always focused on the major issues, has covered this cow politics angle extensively. In fact they covered this cow politics so seriously that for the first time in Indian history, a news from Meghalaya made national news.Expressing their frustration, a representative of the Indian Cows Association said ,?I don?t know man, cover the economy or foreign affairs or national security or even some baba, they are still around, but please leave us alone. Every time we switch on the TV or open a newspaper, it is?Gaurakshaks?or beef or cow slaughter, what is this??Furthermore, the angry cow added ,?It wasn?t always like this. There were beef bans in several states in the past, cow slaughter was also banned in some places, but nobody cared. We were living a content life. However, since this Modi came to power, all our privacy has been lost. Every cow has 4 news cameras focused on it as every reporter waits with bated breath for something to happen around us. There is simply no escape from this media attention, I don?t know how Virat Kohlis and SRKs of this world live with all this media attention. it is simply too much for us.?When asked if they will boycott news channels completely if they don?t leave cows alone, the cow said ,?We can avoid the TV channels but what to do about newspapers. People offer us?roti?on a plate made of a newspaper only. It is impossible to keep our eyes off the news while eating. it is a nightmare.?As per our sources inside Cows Association, many cows are now planning to sit in the middle of the road outside all media offices to register their protest.',fake

'How many times has it happened that you saw a lame joke on Facebook or check-ins of your best friend enjoying in Europe without you or photos of your Ex getting married and you wished you could just slap them hard?Well, attention all Facebook users! Your wish is about to come true. Very soon, Facebook is going to launch a ?slap? reaction for posts. Yes, you read it right! And that?s not it. It will even send an executive to slap someone if number of slaps on their post crosses 100.Last Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the details of this new feature in a press conference. He stated, ?Since quite a long time, people were asking us to add a reaction that would express their true feelings. Now, we all know that a ?like? or a ?heart? on our colleague?s ?Got promoted? post is more artificial than these flowers? as he points to the fake flowers kept on the table.?So we have finally decided to come up with a ?slap? reaction. Users can now slap anyone on Facebook and that too for any reason. Don?t like a status? Slap the person. Envious of vacation photos? Slap everyone who went there. Depressed about your crush getting married? Slap their spouse. You see we?re trying to bring people more close than ever.?But this was not it. He further added, ?But this is not it. There?s a catch to this. If the no. of slaps on a post crosses 100, Facebook would send an executive to slap the person, wherever he or she is?. Yes, even we?re boggled by this amazing technology.When asked about the feasibility and cost involved with this new feature, he added, ?See, by hiring executives for slapping people, or as we call them ? Slapchatters, yes this is an original name, we are basically increasing the employment. We have appointed Dayanand Shetty (a.k.a. Daya of CID fame) as our Chief of Staff for Slapchatters. He will be personally teaching each and every Slapchatter, the basics of slapping.?He explained the technology with an example, ?Suppose you bail out on your friends for a dinner plan citing you?re ill. And just hours later you check-in at a location with your girlfriend. Obviously, all of your friends will slap you for your check-in. And if the anger is so high that the slap counter crosses 100, the waiter at your location will slap you. Yes, we have tied up with many restaurants for this.?This feature is hands down the best feature Facebook has ever had. So grab your gear and get ready to spread some slappiness!',fake
'New York- A shocking number that raises question over misplaced priorities of humans, a latest research revealed today that overall PR budget of entire planet earth crossed ?a whopping $400B last year. This means, earth spent more money than its entire health, food and education budget combined to improve its image in the solar system and beyond.It?s not yet clear who our planet wanted to impress, but experts say it was necessary considering rapidly falling habitabilty on this plant, that, if known to outside worlds, would be enough to discourage any alien interest in settling down here, lowering our self esteem and hurting our ego.When asked if that much amount could have better spent improving condition back here, so the PR wasn?t required in the first place, the expert replied- the damages we?re doing to earth are unjustifiable, irreversible and an ?evil necessity?, hence the only option left for us is to publicize to outside worlds that we?re not actually doing those terrible things.

'You may have heard of parents sending their kids to boarding school to teach them discipline or to make them independent or other personal reasons. But what happened with Parthiv Gupta, a 16-year old kid, will astonish you. Parthiv?s father, Mr. Rajesh Gupta, has sent him to boarding school for removing plastic cover of their TV remote. Yes, you read it right!Rajesh?s neighbor, Mr. Sanjay Sharma, called us to narrate the incident hoping that media spotlight would make Rajesh change his decision. We interviewed Rajesh and here?s what he had to say. ??Before you judge me or label me as a strict father or give me names such as Hitler Qureshi or tell me to watch movies like Taare Zameen Par and 3 idiots, I would like to say that we are middle class people. Not upper middle class. Not lower middle class. We?re the exact middle of middle class. We are so middle class that we are using belan (rolling pin used in kitchen) since last 20 days to remove paste. We live on 3 things ? food, water and EMIs. My son Parthiv very well knows that most of the things we have in the house are second hand. And if there is something that is new, we first worship it for at least 6 months and try to keep it as new as possible for however long we can,? he said. ?Just 2 months ago, we bought a new TV after saving for 10 months. And when I came home 3 days ago, I was stunned to see that Parthiv had removed the cover of the TV remote. You go and ask any middle-class family what the remote cover means to them. It is sacred for us. Parthiv clearly lacks the basic fundamentals of a middle class family so I have sent him to an affordable boarding school where they?ll teach him how to value things such as remote covers. So if you want to call me names I?m fine with it, but it is for my son?s own good,? he added.This is when our reporter accidentally broke a glass kept on the table.

'In the world of American jurisprudence sometimes the discovery method is just as unsavory as the madness. ?In the case of the FBI taking down the child pornography (porn) website Playpen, the way law enforcement went about finding out who the USERS of the site were really is hard to swallow. ?They went to a federal magistrate judge in Virginia and got permission to get into Playpen, a site hidden on the dark web via a system known as Tor, and use it for a bit (13 days) to plant malware on subscribers? computers. ?The malware in question sends identification data and computer addresses then to law enforcement.That worked so well, the boys in blue went to ANOTHER magistrate in Maryland and got control of at least 20 more sites according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.In the normal course of the operation of a web site, a user sends ?request data? to the web site in order to access that site. While Websites 1-23 operate at a government facility, such request data associated with a user?s actions on Websites 1-23 will be collected. That data collection is not a function of the NIT. Such request data can be paired with data collected by the NIT, however, in order to attempt to identify a particular user and to determine that particular user?s actions on Websites 1-23.There was just one problem with that method of catching not just the producers of child porn, but the consumers. ?It?s an eensy weensy little bit illegal.Of the more than 100 Playpen-related child pornography cases that have been prosecuted, federal judges in Iowa, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma have ruled that such a search violated current laws of federal procedure and was in fact so egregious that the evidence collected as a result should be tossed. Other judges have rebuked prosecutors for unlawful searches, but they?have not gone so far as to suppress evidence.As abhorrent as consumption of child porn is, entrapment is plain and simply against the law. ?And planting malware on an unsuspecting perpetrator?s computer who was unknown to investigators before the investigation began is a form of entrapment, even if the consumer was into something illegal. ?He or she didn?t know they were being scooped up in a net. ?Furthermore, the scooping was not done in public as legal undercover videos are, but via planting malware on personal property where an individual should have a reasonable expectation of privacy.This is all allowed thanks to something called Rule 41, a provision for senior judges to issue out of jurisdiction warrants.Under one part of the current rules of federal jurisprudence, known as Rule 41, only more senior federal judges, known as district judges, have the authority to issue out-of-district warrants. However, a change in this rule set to take effect on December 1, 2016 will expand this power to magistrate judges, absent Congressional action.This example highlights a portion of the law that is inadequate for fighting cybercrime of all sorts. The unfortunate aspect of it is that the crime in question is consumption to the point of ownership of child pornography. ?It is one of the few times one would think that the letter of the law could be relaxed given the gravity of the crime. ?Unfortunately, no. ?It puts too many civil rights for all Americans on tenuous footing.',fake
'FBI Director: The good law enforcement professionals within the FBI have had enough of their reputations being tarnished and their integrity blighted by their political hack Director. Jim Comey had a reputation for integrity and fidelity to the law when he was lesser known. The lack of character and his willingness to compromise for political expediency displayed in the Hillary Clinton fiasco have changed all of that.The FBI rank and file are in revolt and making moves to speak out before Congress and elsewhere regarding the conflicts of interest, blatant lies, violations of standard practices and the double standard that clearly now the rule of the day under FBI Director Jim Comey, Loretta Lynch and Hussein Obama.The FBI has gone from being an unbiased law enforcement operation to a subjective partisan arm of the Obama regime. Two agents, who are upset with the current state of affairs, provided a written statement, a copy of which was forwarded to the Daily Caller. One of those agents said of the decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton, ?This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have been convened, but was not. That is appalling. He added, ?We talk about it in the office and don?t know how FBI Director Comey can keep going.?Among the most glaring breaches of protocol and best practices was the failure to search the Clinton house. The outraged agent wrote, ?We didn?t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material.?A second special agent who worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by FBI Director Comey?s remarks, specifically his taking cover among the reputations of the real investigators, the real FBI guys. Comey repeatedly used references such as, ?the team, ?we? and ?I?ve been an investigator.? Comey is attempting to provide the appearance that he is experienced in investigative matters, but he?s just a lawyer.Jim Comey worked for both Lockheed Martin and HSBC as they became entangled in the Clinton Foundation web during his non-public payroll periods, earning $6 million with Lockheed. His brother, Peter Comey, works for DLA Piper, one of the firms receiving special consideration as a donor to the Clinton campaign in the Podesta emails. Clearly Comey understands how pay to play works and he?s part of the Obama Clinton team. His pathway is quite similar to that of Loretta Lynch though she lacks much of the ?visible private sector? employment. She has made some very favorable rulings for Clinton Obama connected entities such as HSBC.The Daily Caller provided Comey?s career path in condensed form as ?After graduating from law school, Comey became a law clerk to a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan and later became an associate in a law firm in the city. After becoming a U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Comey?s career moved through the U.S. Attorney?s Office until he became Deputy Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.After Bush left office, Comey entered the private sector and became general counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, among other private sector posts. ?President? Barack Obama appointed him to FBI director in 2013 replacing out going-director Robert Mueller.?The second agent stated, ?Comey was never an investigator or special agent. The special agents are trained investigators and they are insulted that Comey included them in ?collective we? statements in his testimony to imply that the SAs agreed that there was nothing there to prosecute.? The opposite was the case, as the agent said, ?All the trained investigators agree that there is a lot to prosecuted but he stood in the way.? He added, ?The idea that [the Clinton/e-mail case] didn?t go to a grand jury is ridiculous.?Joe DiGenova, a Washington D.C. attorney said agents are beginning to come forward, wanting to talk about what is happening at the bureau. The ?special treatment? Mrs. Clinton and her cohorts received has many of them in near revolt and they are maneuvering for position to be called by Congress to testify under subpoena when they get back in session. There?s still an election in Congress? futures so they have to at least put on the appearance of representation.In an interview last week on WMAL radio, DiGenova said, ?People are starting to talk. They?re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked today to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away, it?s not.??People inside the bureau are furious. They are embarrassed.? DiGenova said, ?They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he?s a crook. They think he?s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau inside right now is a mess. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.?Clearly Comey deliberately misinterpreted the statutes in order to provide the outcome his masters, be they within the administration alone or outside as well, were paying him to deliver. Now, as the rank and file become rankled, Comey may be joining Mrs. Clinton at the defendant?s table, at least until Obama delivers the pardon.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'We?ve all heard the reports from former Secret Service agents that former First Lady [cough] Hillary Clinton was known inside the agency as an unpleasant person to be around. ?In fact, being part of her detail was known to be a punishment of sorts. ?With the release of 100 pages of FBI transcripts that description is confirmed. This is from a statement taken from an FBI agent?with the State Department?s Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) during Clinton?s time as secretary of state.[Redacted] explained that CLINTON?s treatment of DS agents on her protective detail was so contemptuous that many of them sought reassignment or employment elsewhere,? the interview summary says. ?Prior to CLINTON?s tenure, being an agent on the Secretary of State?s protective detail was seen as an honor and privilege reserved for senior agents. However, by the end of CLINTON?s tenure, it was staffed largely with new agents because it was difficult to find senior agents willing to work for her.?SHOCKER!Not only was Hillary ?unpleasant? to work with, but she really did have the opinion that rules were for everyone else.?From her own experience, and information obtained through [redacted] and other agents, [redacted] described a ?stark difference? between [Condoleezza] RICE and CLINTON with regard to obedience to security and diplomatic protocols,? the summary says. ?RICE observed strict adherence to State Department security and diplomatic protocols while CLINTON frequently and ?blatantly? disregarded them.?Many of us have our disagreements with Condi Rice, but the woman is a lady. ?She knows how to behave and respect other people and governments. ?Of course, President George W. Bush was known for his punctuality and protocol adherence, so for his Secretary of State to follow the letter of the rules should be no surprise.The agent said that it is standard diplomatic and security protocol for the secretary of state to travel by armored limousine with the U.S. ambassador when visiting a foreign country.?CLINTON refused to do so, instead choosing to be accompanied in the limousine by her Chief of Staff, HUMA ABEDIN.

'If the news coming out of Washington and New York is accurate, score one for Dr. Charles Krauthammer. ?When the presence and use of a personal server by Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State was discovered and publicized last spring, he was the one to say that in the end it would all be about the Clinton Foundation and keeping its activity officially off the record books.Fox News is reporting that behind the headlines, the FBI has multiple parallel high priority investigations going on into the pay to play activity of the Clinton Foundation through the White Collar Crime Division in Washington. ?In addition, sources tell them that information and evidence is pouring into the investigative agency, and not all of it is from the WikiLeaks caches that have been systematically released in recent weeks.Key Takeaways via RCP: 1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year.2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time.3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton?s secret server on Anthony Weiner?s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is ?likely? in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, ?barring some obstruction in some way? from the Justice Department.5. FBI sources say with 99\% accuracy that Hillary Clinton?s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.Here is Bret Baier explaining it to Brit Hume:Essentially, then, the pay to play investigation is off the charts HUGE behind the scenes. ?Somehow, the FBI managed to keep that quiet for over a year, and is now collecting even more evidence that may well claim more scalps in the legal sense than just Hillary Clinton.Stay tuned, this story is developing.',fake

'Massachusetts: If you too are habitually flaunting underwear outside your jeans in order to impress and attract women, then beware.A reputed institute making research on reproductive capabilities of species has claimed it can make you impotent. As the popular saying goes-I wandered here and there, to become Macho-Man, Alas! My bad luck, I became half-man!Like always, this is also a contribution of western influence, and is called ?sagging? in popular culture there.Men usually wear their underwear a bit higher than their pant to flaunt their expansive underwear brand, such as Jokey and Hanes. According to psychologists, men do this trick to attract women for mating. This behavior was developed in humans through?millions of years of natural selection, and proves Charles Darwin?s theory of Evolution.Although this habit was developed naturally in order to help men reproduce more, because it creates apt environment for mating, but researchers say this has weakened our natural ability to attract women, that according to Natural Selection process, will fade away and go extinct.

'Flies aren?t the most intelligent of creatures. They, like Democrat voters, are instinctively drawn to bull crap. The higher the concentration the more irresistible it is.

Nature told him land here, his toxicity survival instincts overruled and told him to buzz off.Clinton is lucky that the fly landed on her face while her eyes were closed.

'New Delhi- Taking a cue from its larger Eastern neighbour, sports officials in India are mulling making football the India National Sport. Currently, hockey is the national sport and cricket is most followed sport; but football does not feature in either. The officials want to change that, but why?China has made big news in recent years by buying prominent football clubs across UK and Europe. If you thought the Chinese wanted to profit from the game?s following in Europe, you are slightly mistaken.China aspires to use this connection to European football talent to improve the standard of play inside China. Not only will it help nurture local talent, but the number of tournaments and leagues formed in China as a result will create thousands of jobs of local Chinese. Plus, if the great footballers from Europe also play in China under player-exchange agreements, it will fill up the stadium seats.But the real reason is not just this. It is a much bigger objective. It is not just about football, but of wider political importance for China.It so happens that most of the powerful nations in the world are all football playing nations. If China wants to cement its position in this league of big nations, it feels it should also be a top name in football. If the big boys of the world play football, so will China. In this way, China?s name will always feature in the same league as the most powerful nations on earth.An example is the G-7 list of countries, which includes the big boys of North America, West Europe and Japan. Even China aspires to be counted when newspapers talk of the big nations. Thus, it?s a huge effort of its global branding.It is just like most business deals are struck on the golf-course, and many business executives learn golf just so they are also on the golf course in case business is also discussed. In the same way, it seems many big political decisions are struck amongst the powerful nations in football pavilions. If China aspires to cement its place further in the global political arena, being a top football playing nation may be one of the ways to get there.',fake
'Anybody who has been following the latest cache of wikileaks goodies ? the John Podesta gmail account release ? knows that the blame for their availability is being laid at the door of Russian Intelligence. ?After all, the meme and narrative goes, everyone KNOWS that Julian Assange is a Russian Intelligence asset and they are hacking away at the Democratic National Committee and other prominent Democrats? private email accounts and STEALING the information inside. ?Not only that, but it is ILLEGAL for anyone other than the owner to be in possession of the material.Blah, blah, blahWell, there?s some problems with that:When it comes down to it, though, Craig Murray, a former U.K. Ambassador, put it best after a quick visit with Assange this week to dispel the rumors of the Aussie?s demise:Sometimes I quite enjoy my life. If you can?t annoy the arrogant bastards who run the world for the 1\%, what point is there in living? (Emphasis added.)UPDATEI left Julian after midnight. He is fit, well, sharp and in good spirits. WikiLeaks never reveals or comments upon its sources, but as I published before a fortnight ago, I can tell you with 100\% certainty that it is not any Russian state actor or proxy that gave the Democratic National Committee and Podesta material to WikiLeaks. The claim is nonsense. Journalists are also publishing that these were obtained by ?hacking? with no evidence that this was the method used to obtain them.This writer is toying with a few ideas of what could be afoot, but without proof, the speculation would not do anyone any favors. ?Just remember, the authenticity of the emails has never been denied, and John Podesta himself has not said the emails were stolen. ?That came from CNN.What adds fuel to the conspiracy theory fires is the curious way the Department of Homeland Security ? not a place like the FBI where the lifers are at odds with leadership ? hinted at Russian involvement.. . . are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process.

It does not originate the material. I have often seen comments such as ?Why has WikiLeaks not published material on Israel/Putin/Trump?? The answer is that they have not been given any. They publish good, verifiable material that they are given by whistleblowers. They are not protecting Israel, Putin, or Trump. Nobody has given them viable material.',fake
'Is this Fox News or MSNBC? The anchor is one of those newer faces on Fox, one who upholds the most rigorous CNN or NBC standards for Trump minimization or at least that is how things appear in this interview. Rule number one for Elizabeth Whatshername is clearly not to allow a positive statement regarding Mr. Trump or a negative one about Mrs. Clinton. If Pastor Robert Jeffress wants to slam Trump or endorse Clinton, then she?ll let him speak. Otherwise, she is to cut and interrupt his summary in the infamous rude style of MSNBC?s Chris Matthews following each question. This is the new Fox, more liberal propaganda, less news.She asks Pastor Jeffress how he defends the ?most recent audio leak that we?ve seen,? recent as in eleven years old. ?It?s guy talk, a private conversation and none of yours or anyone else?s business. Ask Clinton about her health, lies, Russian uranium and selling of government secrets? would be the quick, 27 word response. Pastor Jeffress takes a little longer and a slightly less direct path.He says, ?These statements were lewd, offensive and indefensible but they?re not enough to make me vote for Hillary Clinton. He points out a statement he made the week prior with Trump seated next to him of, ?Look, I might not choose this man to be a Sunday school teacher in my church, but that?s not what this election is about.?Too positive, time to cut him off as Elizabeth Whatshername springs into action. She says, ?But it?s also about electing someone with character and with judgment [like Clinton?],? asking if he?s grown in the ten years between sixty and seventy and whether or not his judgment has really changed.?This bimbo needs to get out of the house and the studio more often. Maybe she should actually interact with a few real heterosexual guys, in groups where they?re talking freely, like around a football game at someone?s home. Give them enough time to get a beer buzz and wait for the TV cameras to find the cheerleaders. She might want to test their response to one of those college game cheerleader pyramids in particular, the ones where the girls on each side have one leg raised and the camera is inevitably held at a blatantly obvious angle just underneath. That?s an ?accidental? shot that keeps happening, week after week, year after year, repeated over and over without anyone so much as noticing or commenting, right Elizabeth? Well, maybe occasionally a WNBA player might notice but no guys do unless their some kind of disgusting animals.And how about the Super Bowl halftime show with Beyonce doing her trademark ?air copulation? followed by grabbing herself in a most suggestive manner that is then mimicked by her dancer entourage. It includes multiple displays of the electro-shock butt-shakes that look not unlike Hillary Clinton before she recommends ?the cold choc.? And did anyone notice that she?s in her underwear? (Beyonce, not Hillary) Nobody but that womanizer Donald Trump, right naive Elizabeth?What Trump was exhibiting is something called normal male behavior. He?s not like her Fox coworker Shepard Smith or one of the many other New York metrosexuals who arise in the morning and self-identify their gender of the day as they?re deciding on what to wear. Patricia or Patrick, decisions, decisions.She asks how Jeffress would convince his congregation that he supports traditional family values. Maybe he could recommend that they look at Trump?s family, many married and with children. Why not look at this position on abortion versus the baby-killing Democrats?Pastor Jeffress tries to get the point across that we need a capable, honest leader, we don?t need a preacher-in-chief but it?s no use. Her job is to fulfill the new? Fox prime directive as they march headlong into the leftist propaganda media mainstream.Sabotage Donald Trump; it?s easy, pretend you?re someone you?re not, that he?s something he?s not, and that you?re outraged by a guy being a guy.

'Glenn Beck has clearly always had that side to him that doesn?t make sense, that side that makes you certain?he must be secretly?hitting the sauce again. Sure the round glasses and the ?Hee Haw? beard and sweater were a part of his shtick to make him look ?professorly,? as someone who could be trusted as knowing what he was talking about. Sometime it was enough, often the effort was wasted once he opened his mouth.Even a fully-crocked lush in the midst of a full-knee crawling, toilet hugging stupor arguably has a better grip on reality than Mr. Beck. The shouted retching coming from such an individual positioned alongside their favorite, ceramic bowl (one not containing smashed Cheetos) can at least be dismissed as the incoherent, reflexive responses to some negative internalized stimuli. Wait a minute, come to think of it, maybe there?s not that much difference between a guy puking his brains out and the ?intellectual? ravings of the formerly respected commentator. Maybe it?s just Glenn being Glenn.It would take a book to document his bizarre behavior of the past. One noteworthy comment of late was his barely backhanded endorsement of Hillary Clinton. He?s gone from taste-testing Mark Zuckerberg?s sneakers, telling us that Facebook doesn?t censor conservatives and constitutionalists when we experience it on a daily basis, to supporting Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Beck is clearly out of his mind.Last Saturday Beck proved that point by posting an anti-Trump rant on his Facebook page and portraying Hillary Clinton, the lying pilfering spy and Butcher of Benghazi, as a more moral choice for president of the United States. After all, Glenn?s purity was tainted by the crass bus comments and Beck?s going to have to scrub his ears for hours just to get it back.Beck started off with what is actually a true, coherent remark, that ?Every person, each of us must decide what is a bridge too far.? He then set about showing us that he?s crawling out from under the bridge and, don?t look, he?s gonna jump.He went on to cite his fellow Mormon and globalist tool, Senator Mike Lee, who, as my dad used to say, ?couldn?t say sh*t if he had a mouthful of it,? describing him as having an internal struggle that has reached the point where he could not compromise. It?s baloney, of course. Lee has been in Romney and Ryan?s pocket throughout the election and is still trying to sink Trump on their behalf and that of their globalist establishment. Lee has no moral foundation for any outrage, he?s a purchased tool.Beck said of Lee, ?It is not acceptable to ask a moral, dignified man to cast his vote to help elect an immoral man who is absent decency or dignity. Trump is not an immoral man, as both of those?judgmental hypocrites know. The objective is to sink Trump to make room for the establishment status quo, which is what he?and little Mittens Romney are doing.Beck attempted to portray their treachery as the high road, saying, ?If the consequence of standing against Trump and for principles is indeed the election of Hillary Clinton, so be it. At least it is a moral, ethical choice.? Voting for the most corrupt candidate in history, whose reckless disregard and carelessness has gotten Americans killed, who has had a Muslim Brotherhood operative in her office and probably her bed for over twenty years in Huma Abedin and betrayed this country for cash in our most sensitive areas is, in the opinion of ?Crap Head?Beck,? a moral, ethical choice.He babbled on, ?If she is elected, the world does not end?. Once elected, Hillary can be fought. Her tactics are blatant and juvenile, and battling her by means of political and procedural maneuvering or through the media , through public marches and online articles, all of that will be moral, worthy of man of principal [sic]. Her nominees can be blocked, her proposed laws voted down.?This turncoat?globalist shill claims we can count on the traitors, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, to effectively battle Hillary Clinton. We can trust them to stop her on Important issues such as Supreme Court nominees, when they gave away our Internet, approved Loretta Lynch, Jeh Johnson and John Kerry, wouldn?t fight amnesty, won?t impeach an illegal alien in the White House because he?s half black, uttered not a peep on the climate hoax deals and gave away their 2/3 ratification threshold on both the Iran deal and TPP. They wave a white flag before Obama gets to the ?d? in surrender yet these charlatans are going to defend America from the Clinton crime syndicate?Sweet little innocent Glenn is willing to take that chance because that big bad man said some words he didn?t approve of. False moral high ground is more important than the future of our nation. As a slave to liberalism, he prefers to righteously lick his?wounds as?our children suffer, comfortable in the knowledge that he exacted his?revenge on that ?foul mouthed heathen? as they head off to work in the collective farms. That?s the premise although he expects to be saved from the farms, given one of those good jobs, like collecting the jewelry, gold teeth, or sorting the clothes of the patriots who are no more.Saying that if ?one helps to elect an immoral man to the highest office, then one is merely validating his immorality, lewdness, and depravity,? Beck makes his pitch for removing Mr. Trump, which has been his position all along. We could replace him with?. maybe a Canadian. Maybe Ted Cruz is still available. Or the guy who lost last time, maybe he could win a three week campaign. That would be just the kind of respectability and sincerity that Senator Lee and Beck are looking for.Beck closed saying, ?Trump stepping down does not guarantee a Clinton win, but it does guarantee that the Republican party still stands for something, still allows its members to maintain their own self respect and that it still has a future.?Actually it does guarantee a Clinton win as the lying political operative well knows and it?s probably the only way she can win. It?s also pretty obvious that the timing is orchestrated, as are his comments, in order to help the NWO globalists seal the deal and complete their destruction of America.Don?t worry about your self respect or future Mr. Beck. You lost both of those as well as your audience long ago, when you revealed your true self. By the way, Glenn, now that you?re all wrapped up in your morality and all, do you still hate the 9/11 families??Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake

'In the past couple of weeks, a political term that has a specific meaning has been thrown around a lot in the alternative media by both the writers and those commenting. ??Gaslighting? has come up over and over, because that is what the mainstream media is doing with all the poll numbers that do not reflect the reality of the campaign trail. ?How is it possible, asks the honest and trusting Trump supporter, that Hillary Clinton could be up in the polls when she can?t even fill a hotel ballroom?The answer is gaslighting.The term itself comes from a classic 1938 play that was turned into a phenomenal film in 1944 staring Ingrid Bergman as the woman who is gaslighted. ??Gaslight? refers to the lamps in the house of a husband and wife. ?In the evening, the husband would go into the attic to look for a treasure that was supposed to be buried there. ?When he turned up the lights in the attic, the lights in the main living space would dim. ?When the wife asks her husband about this, he tells her its all in her imagination, thus making her think she is going mad over time. ?This form of mental abuse ? making people doubt what they are seeing is true, and what they know to be true ? became known as ?gaslighting.?Gaslighting, then, is more or less psy-ops, a battle for the mind, or to train the mind to see something that isn?t there and plant the seeds of doubt. ?With all of the non-reporting and half reporting, the gaslighting by the mainstream media in the United States has gone what is known as ?scorched earth,? a military term. ?(Think what Sherman did to the south in his march to the sea.

Naveen said, ?I have never taken more than 10 seconds to reply to her. There were many instances when it wasn?t possible to reply to her text but I still managed. Many a time I couldn?t board my office bus even when I was right there at the bus stop only because replying to her texts was my priority.?Disturbed with the incident, Naveen went home to see his mother like he does every time he gets into a fight with his girlfriend. Our Faking News reporter tried reaching out to Swati but she?s not replying to out calls or texts.This can?t be denied that technology has brought people closer but at the same time same technology has created problems that were never there. Blue tick i.e. read receipts on whatsapp is one such problem.In any relationship the most crucial thing is how patiently can you listen to each other. Blue tick means the receiver has acknowledged what you said but it still doesn?t give the sender a sense that how interestingly receiver listened and that?s why reply to every text has become more important.',fake
'Facebook friends of Shruti (21), a resident of South Bombay, were left in a tizzy after she uploaded her unedited picture on Facebook. Shruti, who is fondly called ?photoshop? by her friends, decided to upload an unedited picture to show her never-seen-before look to her friends. However, the move backfired as everyone in the comments section started asking her who the girl in the picture was.People did not just ask who the girl in the picture was, they also reprimanded Shruti by asking her not to misuse someone else?s pictures on Facebook. A comment read, ?Please remove it because the girl in the picture can sue you for uploading this picture without her consent?. Devastated, Shruti removed the picture and deactivated her Facebook profile for 20 minutes to escape the trauma, after which, she reactivated her profile and uploaded another edited selfie with the caption ?B@cK w!tH A b@nG, H@terzZ keEp H@t!ng xoxo?.As quoted by her friends, Shruti was not only a make-up enthusiast but also a person who applied multiple filters to her pictures before uploading it. ?She?d open the phone camera and start trying the filters before clicking the picture. Once the ?filtered? picture is clicked, she would again go to photo-editing applications and edit it. Her phone was full of photo-editing software programs. You name it and she has it,? recalls Shruti?s best friend.Pranav, Shruti?s boyfriend spoke to our reporter and shared his experience of having Shruti as his girlfriend. ?You look at her pictures; with each upload, she looks different.

'Many Americans watched the globalist Newt Gingrich as he supported Donald Trump throughout the primary, almost in disbelief, expecting there had to be more to this than met the eye. We suspected an eventual attempt at co-opting the movement was in the cards, which would have been successful had Gingrich been able to maneuver himself into the Vice-Presidency.Trump was too smart for that, opting instead to go with Governor Mike Pence, someone like himself, who was more free of the DC contamination and who came without strings attached. We waited for the other shoe to drop, for the establishment insider Gingrich to reveal himself and what he was really up to. That other shoe fell on Thursday morning on Fox Business News. It came from the direction of Gingrich?s mouth.Gingrich took it personally when Trump called out the traitor Paul Ryan, his fellow world government devotee, for his disloyalty and attempted sabotage of his campaign. He didn?t cover for the duplicitous Mr. Ryan who is believed to have played a role in the release of the Billy Bush Bus Ambush video and who certainly was no friend to the candidate. Ryan, in league with Senators Mike Lee, John McCain, Jeff Flake and other of the political bordello class, attempted unsuccessfully to destroy Mr. Trump?s campaign and they are still doing so in spite of their being exposed.Gingrich seems to have taken the mission of diverting attention away from the traitors, of telling the American public, including those that might decide not to vote for Paul Ryan and his fellow snakes in the grass, that there?s no point to the public knowing what they?re made of. The fact that they are turncoats who attempted a coup with a month left before the election, on the eve of the second debate in a move that would have destroyed a lesser candidate is not something Gingrich believes should be addressed.Gingrich is showing his own stripes and where his loyalties really lie. He created a sound bite and media quote of ?little Trump is frankly pathetic.? Gingrich is a seasoned political professional and who knew exactly what he was saying and the tool he was handing the anti-Trump establishment, both GOP and Democrats. There was no justification for wording his comments in that manner yet he chose to publicly align himself with Ryan and the globalists against Mr. Trump and the American people.He did so while pretending to be offering Trump advice. Those were not words intended to help, they were live rounds meant to injure. Of course Trump is not mad over not receiving a phone call from Ryan, he?s mad about being attacked and the phone comments were merely that, comments. Gingrich understands, but he?s able to attack Trump by playing dumb, so he does.He goes on to say, ?Donald Trump has one opponent, her name is Hillary Clinton.? That is a falsehood. He has many opponents, they include the media, Ryan and the NWO boys, George Soros and his front groups, Islamic terrorism facilitators, foreigners in the country voting, Democrats corrupting the system, complicit judges ruling in favor of corruption and many more. To claim that there is a list of individuals or topics that he cannot mention regardless of the magnitude of their offenses is nonsense aimed at protecting his fellow globalists, who will strike again. Ryan is not through, none of them are, and Gingrich is not.There were other ways he could have made his point if that had been what he was after. It wasn?t. The establishment tentacles are securely attached to Gingrich.?The man on the inside, the ?Little Newt,? has been exposed for what he is. There are a lot of reptiles?in that town.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'GOP Elites Declare War Noting that Donald Trump and we Americans are engaged in a multi-front war, he cited Trump?s comments not only in referencing the criminal Democrat as being unfit for office but ?also declared Republican leaders as far more difficult than Clinton because of their weakness and their disloyalty to Republican voters and the Republican nominee.Dobbs noted that the number of Republican voters who said that GOP Congressional candidates should support Mr. Trump rose from 67\% before the debate to 74\% after. And these numbers are as he faces the tsunami of criticism unleashed by the mainstream Clinton propagandists.Mr. Dobbs says, ?Yet Speaker Ryan and dozens of GOP lawmakers are at war now with Republican voters, and make no mistake, it is an open war between those GOP elites and the rank and file of their party because they are the ones who nominated Donald Trump.??Ryan in particular,? says Dobbs, ?seems to be in the death grip of morbid envy and petulance towards his party?s presidential nominee, and supporters and of course, voters. The latest Fox News poll shows seventy percent of Trump backers strongly support him compared to 57 percent for Clinton.??Trump is the leader to turn this country around,? Dobbs says, ?to restore prosperity, to build a better future for all Americans. He is about the future and Hillary Clinton is simply a continuation of the status quo.?He points out, ?The GOP establishment is scared to death that Trump?s election would mean the end of their status quo and they?re right. And sadly, their interests don?t align with the nation?s or those of the American people. Trump is on the right side of history in this campaign and voters should ensure that the elites are history.Unfortunately we?ll have to wait two years to remove Ryan from his position as a Representative in the House but we do not have to wait to replace him as Speaker.

'You?d think by now that conveniently timed publicity GOTCHA! bombs would cease to give the mainstream media, the GOP, and the wussified men of America the vapors, but no. ?The Hillary Clinton campaign released a locker room talk tape of Donald Trump speaking among men about women 11 YEARS AGO in what is considered ?vulgar? language (that means common folk, but no one ever said elites were knowledgeable about linguistics) a little more than 48 hours before the second presidential debate. ?In this audio, the nickname for a cat was used as an indicator of female genitalia. ?(The beta males of the GOP seem to forget that there are much worse words to use when speaking of women?s parts.) ?That alone, and talk of sex, supposedly disqualifies the man for the presidency.What would these people do if they ever went out for a night on the town with a Major League Baseball team? ?Don?t answer that. ?Come on, this was years ago, and the Donald probably didn?t even know it was being recorded.Within MINUTES of this release, every member of the DC Uniparty, including stalwart Trump backers, started calling for Trump to step down from the Republican Party nomination, as if being an alpha male, and shaking the tail feathers around other men was really objectionable in Washington. ?(Do we really need to bring up the Capitol Hill sex grapevine?) ?Even Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ? a man who REALLY needs to go to Confession ? betrayed Trump with that suggestion.Now, to the surprise of NO ONE who looked for the bombshell stories on Hillary and the Democrats that would be overshadowed by the tape release and the mass hysteria from the peanut gallery that refuses to take the blinders off and see that they are being played like a Stradivarius by the ?gatekeepers? of information, word is sneaking out that the GOP knew what Hillary Clinton and her team were up to BECAUSE THEY WERE IN ON IT.(DC Whispers) Clinton operatives, alleged to be working in conjunction with the Washington Post, released a brief audio tape from eleven years ago that captures Donald Trump in some unsavory locker-room banter that included a reference to grabbing a certain part of the female anatomy. Multiple sources have now indicated this tape?s release was initiated weeks earlier, and that both House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP Chair Reince Priebus, had been made aware of its intended use ? and then failed to notify the Trump campaign, making them complicit in the Clinton Machine?s intent to harm the Trump campaign?.Speaker Ryan was scheduled to do a political rally appearance with Trump today. Instead, he indicated he was disgusted and horrified by Trump?s naughty words from eleven years ago, and abruptly cancelled the appearance?.?Apparently, that cancellation had been in the works all along so as to embarrass Trump.Uh-huh. ?As if the alpha dogs out there actually have pristine mouths. ?Having spent a fair amount of time around the people who think they rule the world?yeah, no. ?And the beta males pulling this passive aggressive female-type shtuff (pardon my French), just confirms for all of us salt of the earth deplorables their duplicity. ?We out here on the fruited plain care more about Hillary Clinton getting away with treason than we do Mr. Trump calling a woman?s parts a nickname for a cat.Sorry, y?all, but this one smells. ?And it smells bad. ?And not only that, the timing is so obvious that even the people in the checkout line at the grocery store said the tape?s effect was muffed. ?(Oops. ?Did I say that?) ?And don?t think this is the end of the sabotage, either. ?Many of us believe it?s just the beginning.',fake

'After a news website broke the story that the turnover of Temple Enterprises, a company owned by Amit Shah?s son, Jay Shah, rose from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80 crores in a year after Narendra Modi got elected as the prime minister, BJP President Amit Shah has defended his son by saying that the sudden rise is a technical problem. Earlier this year, the leader had defended his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots by calling it a technical problem.The rapid increase in the company?s turnover raised several eyebrows as the company which was making a meagre profit increased its turnover by an unbelievable 16,000 times in a period of one year. Amit Shah, hailing the business strategy of Temple Enterprises, said, ?This is exactly the kind of development Narendra bhai keeps talking about. If you think it?s a one-off company that has made profits, you can also check the accounts of any company owned by Mukesh bhai and see for yourself that it is overall development of the country. It?s pure hard work and nothing else.?Interestingly, the company having Rs 80 crores as its turnover shut its operation just a month before demonetisation. Upon being questioned on the timely withdrawal from the market, Jay Shah said, ?It?s all about prediction. If you are an entrepreneur, you have to do business keeping the uncertainty in mind. All thank to my dad?s sixth sense, we predicted demonetisation and stopped our business.? Jay Shah further threatened that he would file a criminal defamation suit against our organisation if we asked him any more questions. Our reporter, who was in dire need to visit the washroom, refrained from asking him the way to the washroom after the threat to avoid getting sued. When Amit Shah realised that the matter has reached Jay Shah?s washroom, he defended his son and said, ?Getting the urge to pee is a technical problem of the journalist.? The All India Football Federation, after identifying Amit Shah?s ability of defending every accusation thrown at him since the 2014 Loksabha elections, announced that Amit Shah will be given the role of the defender in the Indian national football team.

'One of the toughest questions that no one has been able to answer till now is ?acche din kab ayenge??But recently, UNESCO declared ?Am I looking fat?? as the most difficult question of this era. The world has witnessed numerous breakups and divorces because of this question being wrongly answered. A similar incident happened when a boy had to pretend memory loss upon being asked by her girlfriend if she?s looking fat.Surat: On the third day of Navratri, i.e.?Saturday?night, a Garba Night was arranged in a society where Falguni Pathak was going to perform. Super excited Rupesh and his girlfriend Poonam were all dressed up in traditional attire waiting for Falguni Pathak when Poonam, out of the blue, asked Rupesh if she is looking fat. Baffled, Rupesh didn?t expect this and said yes ? no. Poonam started crying to which Rupesh replied, ?aap kaun hain behen ji?.Rupesh?s question shocked Poonam. Apparently, Rupesh had lost his memory. Poonam tried to bring Rupesh back to normal but to no avail. Later, Rupesh was taken to the nearest hospital where he was admitted and supervised by senior doctors. The story took a U-turn when the doctors asked Rupesh to go through some costly tests and Rupesh, being a Gujarati, refused to do those tests and told the doctors that he was pretending to have memory loss.Things have still not sorted out between Rupesh and Poonam but they both are happy that it is not worse than it had looked like a few hours ago. The incident has made it clear that no-one has a perfect answer to ?Am I looking fat?? and the best way to deal with this question is to ignore it.Rupesh has played smart to make his relationship survive. This incident is also a learning for girls who ask such questions even after knowing that no answer would make them fully satisfied.',fake
'The Sarahah portal has gripped the nation with its innovative concept of leaving feedback for people without revealing their identity. Posts from Sarahah have significantly dominated the timelines of Facebook users since the last week. Indian users have been found sharing links to their Sarahah profiles on their Facebook timeline and requesting their friends to leave an anonymous opinion about them that is interesting and worth sharing.Following the trend, Daood (26), a Facebook user from Delhi shared his Sarahah link to his Facebook timeline multiple times but received no feedback. Embarrassed by the poor response, Daood started leaving anonymous feedbacks for himself from fake profiles to share with his Facebook friends.

Daood?s Facebook friend, Amaan, who left us a tip-off regarding the incident, told us, ?Daood is an engineering student. It is not just difficult but impossible for him to have a girl date him.

She predicts that if they were doing that rather than stabbing him in the back as they are now, he?d be up ten points.Hannity agrees that it is stunning that Trump is only down by the small margin that he is, if those numbers are to be believed, given the amount of effort that has been expended on all fronts to sabotage his campaign and to put the reins of government into the hands of the criminal Democrats for four more years. If we can?t trust the media, why would we think polling companies would be any less corrupt?Hannity calls out Paul Ryan in particular among the more vile members of the traitor class, suggesting that regardless of the outcome of the election, a serious discussion needs to take place in the days following the election as to who is the next Speaker.

'Cricketer Hardik Pandya, who is known for heroics on the pitch as for the experiments with his hair, will now be getting hairstyling allowance from BCCI to maintain his crop.The announcement was made ahead of India?s 4th ODI against Sri Lanka by a senior official. The exact amount was not revealed but sources say that it is quite significant.?He (Hardik) likes sporting new hairstyles and has a new one for every series. Since these players are nothing less than brands, grooming is an important part of maintaining that brand value. So BCCI has decided to proivide allowance to players to take care of their grooming needs,? said one official.?As long as it does not affect his game,we are fine with it. He can do whatever he likes with his looks,? the official added.Hardik was happy with BCCI?s gesture and also tweeted images of hairstyles he?d like to try out.Apparently, several cricketers had previously asked the cricketing body for allowances to take care of their grooming needs. ?Virat too wanted tatoo allowance some time back. Other players wanted money for fairness creams, perfumes etc. Probably BCCI will agree to that too,? said a player who didn?t wish to be named.BCCI however made it clear that that facility will be made available only to cricketers are not to commentators and support staff.After the news made its way to social media, a few Pakistani cricketers too asked for similar allowance from PCB, but were immediately reprimanded by the board and were asked to focus on cricket instead. ?Waise hi hamari board ke paas paise nahi hai.

'Hillary Health Video: Inappropriateness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder and if you?re a supporter of global government and the establishment criminal syndicate that has hijacked and now poses as our government, there?s no place for truth. Google supports Clinton, Obama, Soros and the oligarchs so they do what they can on their behalf. There are reasons behind those weekly visits to the dingy-White House and censorship of what the peasant class is allowed to see and be exposed to must surely have been a topic of discussion at some point.As we know Hillary Clinton is the chosen heir to the throne of evil as the successor designate to the previous Soros puppet, Hussein Obama. Donald Trump made a video questioning Clinton?s suspect physical health and fitness for the office. There?s nothing unusual about that, it?s the type of thing candidates do these days; Clinton has a full library of her own attacking her opponent.The status of her failing health would be a legitimate question to ask of any candidate but particularly prudent given all of Clinton ?s odd behavior and time spent away from the campaign, as well as her sudden, unexplained cancellations of fundraisers. That?s the equivalent of not picking up free money lying on the table, quite out of character for the greedy little bridge troll.Google?s protecting her from what they must have determined is a hurtful video, filled with hate speech that accurately depicts the fraud she?s attempting to perpetrate. The Clinton?s are indebted to Google for saving them from as much political pain as possible. While it would have been perhaps illegal or at best a blatant admission of their political agenda to completely remove the Trump video, they were able and more than willing to hide it, to make it more difficult to be seen.The Hillary Health Video was moved from the public, published listings to a non-published one. The video has a one word title of ?Dangerous,? but a search for dangerous turns up only multiple word results, rap videos and the like. A search for Dangerous Trump predictably returns negative results about the people?s candidate.Going to the link directly, one sees a notice in a yellow ribbon, ?This video is unlisted. Be considerate and think twice before sharing.? Of course Mr. Trump wants the video shared and Google knows that. It?s Clinton that wants to hide her health issues and for whom the video is being censored. Otherwise it?s a decent video but there?s nothing particularly noteworthy.Just the existence of questions being asked about her health was enough to prompt Google to censor and hide it. That reinforces what most of us already believe, Clinton?s suffering from serious health issues which the media, and that includes Google, are hiding from the public. She needs to be held accountable for the deception and the questions asked now. The American people want an unbiased medical team to evaluate her fitness, let?s see what they are so fearful of us finding out.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'After Sunday?s debate, while on the flight headed towards what will probably be a hotel near her next event in Detroit, Hillary Clinton took a few minutes to chat it up with her public relations team, also sometimes referred to as the mainstream media.Answering a typical softball along the lines of ?Mama Hillary, were you surprised by the way that mean old uppity Donald Trump talked to you tonight?? Clinton replied, ?Nothing surprises me about him, really, Dan.? Of course Clinton never tells the truth but?we can be fairly certain of one thing. That revelation he made that she?ll be facing a real investigation for her life of crime if he?s elected president was probably not something she expected when she first slithered into the debate arena.Trying to put the best face on what will be the first of many uncomfortable days for Mrs. Clinton over the next month, She said she ?was surprised by the absolute avalanche of falsehoods.? The avalanche of falsehoods was hers, as is always the case. If she was surprised it was probably at how ineffective they were tonight. She might also have been caught off guard by the effectiveness of the return fire.

Now he?s angry and she?s got a real fight on her hands.As her eyes bug out in what has become the new ?normal? for Clinton, she tells the reporters that she finds it ?really unimaginable that someone can stand and just tell, you know, a falsehood after a falsehood.? Why is that so hard for her to believe? She does it multiple times a day. Has she never reviewed any of her videos? Is her mind so far gone that she doesn?t remember her last conversation or speech?It would be hard to imagine Trump doing it, but that isn?t what she said. She said someone and she is someone. Not a very trustworthy, honest, likable or leadership fit someone, but someone nonetheless. She?s someone who just got their butt handed to them on a debate and whose scrutiny?over the next few weeks is going to become a lot more intense and a lot less comfortable.She enlists her assistants in the media to lend their ?credibility? to her weak argument, asking them if they remember Politifact claiming that Donald Trump is untruthful seventy percent of the time and stating that he exceeded that level tonight. She wants people to fact-check because she doesn?t have a lie to counter Trump?s truths. They?re working on that now, so ?check the website.? Hers are clearly made up figures whether the media sycophants and her paid yes men nodding behind her care to admit it or not.Her fawning media may need a third party service to tell them what is true and what isn?t because they?re too ignorant of the facts to do it on their own.

Movie lovers are super excited with Sajid returning as director, but they are upset with producer Sajid Nadiadwala who announced, housefull4 will be ready by 2019 Diwali only.?2019 Diwali means I have to wait for two more years and considering Humshakals came in 2014, we will get a chance to see our all-time favorite director?s movie after 5 long years. Bahut na insafi hai ye hamara saath,? said Kamal R Khan, who claims he is the president of Sajid Khan fan association.When some news channels sources started reporting Kamal and his friends are planning to teach producer Nadiadwala a lesson, Sajid Khan came forward to clear the air. ?Housefull 4 will not be like my previous movies, this will have a solid script. Myself and my team have gone through two dozen DVDs, I am sorry, what I meant is two dozen scripts. All are so good, we are unable to finalize which one we would pick for houseful 4. That?s the reason we have not decided the cast for the movie. So, do not blame Nadiadwala bhai for the delay in movie release.?We talked to one of the close assistant of Sajid who is involved with the scripting process. While speaking to us anonymously, he said, ?Sajid Bhai arranged DVDs from different corners of the world, which was more than two thousand to start with. After going through all of them we have finalized the 12, which Sajid Bhai is watching with us. Now we have to select one, add some of our own creative footage so that no one can blame us for copy right violation. Our part was ready long time back, we are just checking where it can go seamlessly.? ??Sajid for a change does not want to repeat his earlier mistake of saying housefull 4 will be the biggest block buster of 2019. ?Box office collection mere haath mein nahin ye. But script is in my hands. Undoubtedly it would be the best script of the year,? said Sajid in his trademark super confident manner. ',fake
'KANPUR:?Not one but several girls were denied entry into the posh school ground where the annual P.T. display was underway recently. Some were genuinely denied permission for being ex-students but some interested girls were discarded entry without any genuine reason. The invitation card was given to the school students indicated in bold small letters of the parents? entry during the programme. ?However, the school staff?s stiff stand restricted a good many girls? direct access to relish yearly show.A very peculiar case was seen at the school gate when one mother and one sister of the school?s authentic student did not get entry simply because the man in tie and pant was not ready to accept what was vehemently rejected by the girl. He was insisting upon her this prestigious school?s ex-student. The girl happened to be a bonafide senior student of St. Joseph?s School here. She even told this fact to the haughty man positioned at the entry gate. He never realised that the girl was speaking the truth. What he emphasised upon was that she should show her identity card if she was linking her identification with another school.?Unfortunately, the girl student did not carry her ID at that point in time.She was even suggested by the heartless man to bring her school?s identity card from the residence at nearly six kilometres away. ?What remained most irritating for the girl was making her ex-student of the school where the programme was in progress. The man would have simply forbidden her entry under the order. But he created wholly a different story for stopping her. That was indeed against the school?s traditions normally. He should have known that a crowd entered the school after 4 pm through the next large gate. That girl returned with a long face as she missed her younger sister?s pyramid display. She was wrongly assumed as ex-student despite her continuous denial.',fake
'Huckabee Sets Trump Straight: Governor Mike Huckabee believes that Donald Trump is on to something, though it might arguably not be where he should be devoting as much of his attention as he is. He notes, ?The media is in an absolute frenzy to do everything they can to destroy the man. I mean, they sat on this stuff for years and they waited until just before the election to try to release it and then they play it nonstop.?Huckabee says, ?And voices far more objective than mine, media critics and others, have recognized journalism in this country is dead as we used to know it. There is no such thing; it?s all advocacy. Now, what I wish Donald Trump would do, let surrogates fight the press. He needs to fight the battle for Americans on jobs and immigration.?Huckabee sets Trump straight he says if Trump calls him today that?s what he?ll tell him. ?You go out there and fight the people?s battles, because they?re sick of open borders and they know with Hillary the Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment are all on the table. They know with Hillary that abortion is going to be more prolific than ever. They know that with Hillary taxes go up, they know that our national security interests go down, that Israel can?t depend, I mean we could go through a litany.??Focus on those things,? Huckabee says, ?and remind people that this election is not about something Donald Trump said 11 years ago, this is about the future of the country.MacCallum comes up with a supposed concern of the American people that Trump would go down rabbit holes in the White House. That?s a new one, she must have thought long and hard to come up with that one. Why not shut the constant criticism and try applauding Mr. Trump for standing up to this onslaught, Martha? Or are you in the tank for Clinton as well?If he doesn?t defend himself at least to a point, the media will adopt that as a validation that it?s working and add his silence to the narrative as ?proof? that the false allegations are true. There is a fine line and he?s trying to walk it. The media is being shown for who they are, Clinton and the crooked Democrats are being similarly exposed.At some point the American people have to have enough sense to arrive at the obvious conclusion. Or maybe they are too far gone. Regardless, more Trump bashing by the formerly fair and balance Fox News isn?t helping the problem.Huckabee?s right, but a little positive press wouldn?t hurt now and then. He points out that as the nominee of the Republican Party, ?they hate his guts.? It?s worse in the case of Trump, as he brings with him the destruction of the system of cronyism the media and their masters have constructed for the security and extension of their positions and power.?This is not a mild sort of gee, we don?t really like him, as we may have seen with other Republicans.

'Mike Lee got his feelings hurt during the primary when his anointed one, Calgary Ted Cruz, was defeated by Donald Trump. He hasn?t gotten past Trump questioning why ?his best friend?s father? was photographed handing out flyers with Lee Harvey Oswald. He also made a statement on video in July (below) that the reason he hasn?t endorsed Trump is because he?s made some religiously intolerant statements that Mormons, as a church that was targeted in the 1800s by the governor of Missouri, can?t deal with. Two hundred years is a long time for them to hold a grudge and Trump isn?t from Missouri, Senator.Mike Lee is a tool of the globalists, just as is his fellow Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and virtually all of their political office holders and influence peddlers. Lee pretends that his sheltered existence and strong faith guide him, and that he is this great constitutional scholar who is guided by our founding principles. That sounds awfully similar to the line of crap many Americans swallowed in 2008 and 2012.He?s actually the most vile of hypocrites, as he clearly demonstrated in the hissy fit he threw over the comments Trump made in the ?Billy Bush Ambush? video. He and his fellow nevertrump globalists are attempting to seize upon it in?a last-ditch effort to derail the choice of the American people. Who knows, perhaps they helped produce it.There is no fidelity to or respect for the Constitution in the hypocrite Mike Lee. There is only a bitter little puppet doing the bidding of Jon Huntsman and others who hold the key to power in his state of Utah, where Mormons vote as they?re told. That?s the same blind obedience that has saddled Nevada and the US with Harry Reid.Lee says he?s been thinking about how Mr. Trump?s statements make him feel, noting several times that he has a wife, a daughter, a mother and five sisters. The drama queen senator says, ?It?s occurred to me on countless occasions today that if anyone spoke to my [insert repetitive list here] the way Mr. Trump has spoken to women, I wouldn?t hire that person. The ?forgiving man? who champions his religion continued, ?I wouldn?t hire that person, wouldn?t want to be associated with that person. And I certainly don?t think I?d feel comfortable hiring that person to be the leader of the free world.?It?s important to remember that this statement is not the result of the video changing Lee?s position on Mr. Trump. He has already refused to endorse him or state that he would vote for him. It?s simply the Mormon mafia Senator (like Harry Reid) using his position to opportunistically attack a candidate that is opposed to the globalism that Lee serves, the subjugation of America to world fascism.He says ?We?ve been asked to settle,? which clearly means Lee still hasn?t admitted his and Glenn Beck?s boy lost. He?s been forced to accept defeat which to him means settling. We got who we wanted, at least to this point, in spite of Lee and his mafia?s best efforts to install their choice or hand the election to Clinton as an alternative. Americans only have to settle if traitorous, disloyal operatives such as him are successful in derailing Donald Trump and empowering Hillary Clinton.Lee doesn?t believe in the popular vote if it doesn?t incorporate a ?Seven Mountains? kind of theocracy as would have been the case if his anointed one had been selected. Americans don?t want a combo preacher/pope/president. We want a president to take care of the nation?s business and we?ll choose our religious affiliation separately, without Senator Lee?s imposition or assistance.Lee claims a fidelity to certain principles, vague and never identified by anything other than ?what will help us win in November,? as he calls Mr. Trump a distraction. Please enlighten us with a recap of the Republican achievements over the last couple of years as you pursued those supposed principles, Senator, while funding every Obama agenda item and refusing to challenge a single illegal act. Those are the principles you want us to support you on in opposition to the man who is our voice?He asks Trump to deny the will of the people, to set aside his record-levels of support because he doesn?t fit Mormon Mike?s model or the Seven Mountains template. ?Sinless Senator? Lee presents himself as our moral compass, one that?s spinning wildly and aimlessly as are our founding fathers in their graves. Mike?s never uttered anything similar to what Trump did. That?s great for him. He?s probably not much fun at parties either, but to each their own; he can shut up now. He?s clearly lying and embarrassing himself.Lee?s admitted to having a daughter, so we might think that at some point conversations occurred during that process that might have had some similarities to the comments of Mr. Trump. Then again, maybe there?s a code of silence in the Lee bedroom. Don?t look, keep your eyes to the floor at all times. They just point and grunt in the dark, and hope for divine intervention. What a dishonest, transparent, politically motivated and mentally unstable specimen this Senator is but it?s not the first time he?s shown his unhinged side.It?s the same kind of emotion he showed in a video referenced earlier and posted below his statement, in which, near the end, he seems to be almost in tears over the stress of the insults to Senator Cruz. This guy?s not all there.The globalist hypocrite trash closes out his little lie-fest by saying, ?It?s time for us to come together.? This is from the guy who still refuses to come together and join the man the American people have selected. Actually it?s not time, Senator Lee, it?s past time and you?re running very late.He adds, ?There will be time to figure out the who.? Again Lee is behind the times as we are under thirty days until the election and the rest of us have long ago figured that part out. ?Maybe his watch needs a new battery. He says it?s time to focus on ?the what? as he urges searching for a different ?globalist who.? Besides being late, Lee?s having a bad pronoun day.He?s still angling for Calgary Ted, his choice as the what (a Canadian citizen in the White House) or the who. He?s not going to settle no matter what. Too bad he isn?t as adamant about keeping Clinton out of the White House, but she?s part of the establishment world government crowd. She?s on his side.The unhinged part of the Lee interview with Steve Malzberg is really fiery beginning at the 7:00 mark below:Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'When a nation has a government of criminals it?s to be expected that they are going to use their positions to engage in criminal activity. At no time in America?s history has that stark reality been more true than under the outlaw Obama regime. Donald Trump met with ICE officers and union officials to discuss the abuse of power the Obama regime is engaging in, when the subject of the outright voter fraud being committed by the pretend ?president? and his DHS henchmen was raised.Trump, who was meeting with and receiving the first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate by the ICE union, is picked up by one of the cameras in a conversation with one of the union representatives who is also a CBP agent.Trump asked why the illegal aliens with criminal records aren?t being kicked out and why are they kicked out and why the big rush to get them citizenship. The ICE official told him the reason is, ?simply so they can vote.?After expressing his mild astonishment, Trump clarifies, ?So they can come into the country so they can vote, how can something like this happen? It?s a disgrace.? He was told, ?It?s happening.? As verification, the host offers a current situation in Indiana in which in over half of the counties the state police are investigating voter fraud. She also points out that no ID is necessary for mail-in voting.Varney would presume that this abuse of the system by the Democrats would put this issue on the forefront of discussion for Sunday. Matt Schlapp believes it will, asking ?What is more sacred than assuring we have the right to vote.? The problem is that nothing is sacred to the Democrats and the establishment elites other than their power and wealth theft mechanisms.Varney is annoyed as are many other people by the Democrats immediately placing a label of bigot upon anyone who wants to protect the integrity of the electoral process by requiring an ID.? Schlapp notes that everything of importance that is done in our society is subject to proof of identification except for voting. It?s wrong to have even the risk of fraudulent voting, including multiple votes. In what is likely to be a close election, Schlapp says it is vital that the integrity of the count and the validity of the ballots cast be beyond reproach.

'In a move favouring the players of the Indian cricket team, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that the lower-order batsmen in the team can visit the tourist attractions in Sri Lanka during India?s batting in the ongoing Sri Lanka tour. The move was shortly announced after the first test at Galle, where several lower-order batsmen complained of not getting the opportunity to bat.The lower order of the Indian batting line-up was seen protesting outside the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai during the second innings of the Indian batting. ?We will bowl our hearts out twice in the ongoing match and won?t get to bat properly even once. Is this gully cricket?? said a furious lower-order batsmen at the request of anonymity. He further suggested that BCCI should come up with an alternative for the lower-order batsmen to kill time during India?s batting. BCCI later announced that the lower-order batsmen can visit the tourist spots in Sri Lanka. ?The cricketers have complained that they cannot go to vacations as we make them play the entire year. Hence, it is desirable that they visit the tourist spots on their official tour,? said a BCCI spokesperson. Following the decision, there are rumours of a fallout between the top order and the lower order of the Indian batting lineup. This was evident after pacer Umesh Yadav uploaded pictures of him vacationing on a Sri Lankan beach. ?Dhawan bhai did not ?like? my pictures on Facebook. He?s upset that he cannot visit the beaches while I can,? said Yadav, hinting at the fallout. Skipper Virat Kohli was happy with the Board?s decision and termed it as a ?progressive move?. ?I don?t want to go to the beach. If I bat twice, I?ll score more runs and only break more records of Sachin paaji,? said a seemingly enthusiastic Kohli. ',fake
'Kashmir: The way smartphones are ruling the roost, they will soon all but have the kitchen sink fitted into them ? technically they just might be able to, thanks to modular phones. With ever newer iPhones (with no useful features) and phones with more powerful computing capabilities than the world?s first supercomputer, it is sometimes terribly refreshing to take a step backwards.And who better than Nokia, the once ruler of the mobile phones market, to reboot one of its hardiest and most iconic phone models ? the Nokia 3310. Yes, the phone everyone has seen in their childhood, that had nothing but endless hours of Snake (the game) to offer, is soon going to be back in business ? with a few improvements, of course.But this has not gone down well with the Indian army which is fighting constant stone pelting in Kashmir. According to the Army, the 3310 will give another option to the separatists to throw at them. And according to latest reports, injuries caused by Nokia 3310 are far worse than that caused by stones. The government plans to levy a hefty excise duty on Nokia 3310 to inhibit its sales in Kashmir.',fake
'Ashutosh, a Bombay High Court judge, was arrested last evening after he entered a taxi despite the taxi driver?s ?no? for the ride. The incident took place outside Churchgate Railway Station when the kaali peeli driver Sukhram refused to ferry Ashutosh to the court. Considering it a feeble ?no?, the judge forcefully entered the taxi, which lead to his arrest and, subsequently, his termination as a High Court judge.The incident has left him in a state of shock after he discovered that the feeble ?no? was a serious ?no?, just like any other form of ?no?, the fact that was unknown to the learned judge. ?Feeble ?noes? mean ?yes?; I?m shocked that I have been arrested for a stupid conflict of consent,? said the judge, ?The matter would have been long resolved if I had molested a girl despite her feeble ?no?, which actually suggests consent. It?s my ill luck that I?m battling it out with a taxi driver instead of a helpless girl who is molested.? Suspended judge Ashutosh appeared in the city court earlier today where he was granted bail. The taxi driver, on the other hand, has hinted vendetta after the judge was released soon after his arrest. ?A ?no? is a ?no?, be it a girl?s dissent or a taxi driver?s. A girl may, for once, say ?yes? if she is interested but we taxi drivers never say ?yes? for a ride. The judge should have known that before barging inside my taxi,? said Sukhram, who claimed to reject close to 100 rides every day.

'On Tuesday night, Instagram users were dejected to see that Instagram was down for 7 hours. The exact reason for its crashing was not revealed by their technical team until today morning.

Putting 100 tags in a post is quite common for me. I have 1784 posts on Instagram till now. No sorry.. 1785 posts.?

Meanwhile, he again posted a photo on Instagram without us realizing it.When asked what the fault of other users was to deserve this, he stated, ?Do you think I don?t care about other users? My own brother is so much addicted to Instagram that he loves biryani pics on Instagram more than the actual biryani. When Instagram crashed, he..? he controls his tears ?he didn?t eat anything that night because he couldn?t see the foodgasm and foodporn hashtag.

'There are some inconsistencies with the claims and actions of the anti-Americans at DHS and within the White House as they relate to the hack of DNC and other databases. The government syndicate claims that Russia is behind it, but a Romanian hacker who goes by the name of Guccifer 2.0 had the documents available for download long before he contacted WikiLeaks for help with distributing them. Romania is not part of Russia.Secondly, the amount of damage that was done as a result of those hacks is relatively minor. It?s not so much a national security issue, at least not that is evident to this point, and not nearly so damaging as the four years of perpetual nonstop security breaches which were standard operating procedure at the Clinton State Department and since in the John Kerry cover up.The hacks that they claim are of such great significance are merely those that are damaging to the political prospects of Democrats such as Hillary Clinton, the embodiment of national security recklessness. Johnson and his globalist Gestapo want to hijack the election for political reasons and they?re taking advantage of the hacks to feed their narrative that, for the sake of the security of the election, they must seize control. Of course they are the last persons on earth who should be anywhere close to our election apparatus.They are exaggerating the threat to either set the stage for a false flag event, to diminish the ability of the Trump campaign to claim the elections were rigged by claiming Democrats were attacked first by the Russians, or to create their own situation in which they are the ones who tamper with and rig the system but then blame their Russian scapegoats. All three possibilities are consistent with the narrative out of the Clinton campaign and the DNC that the Russians are conspiring with the Trump campaign to steal the election, something there is absolutely no evidence of.In an October 12th article in the Washington Examiner, the move to the big steal took another step. The message was that the threat to our election is significant, real and imminent. It stated, ?Concerns about Russian hacking into the November 8 election have now reached the Pentagon where the military?s top cyber official has outlined a plan to help the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to track an election altering attack.? They would then go on to detail the ?reasonable sounding? circumstances under which they are plotting to steal the election.That is the same Homeland ?Security? that has completely dismantled our border, allows virtually anyone with a pulse to claim asylum and has terrorists they label as refugees pouring into our nation at this very moment. They and DHS Secretary Johnson have no security function other than to threaten and degrade it.Adm. Michael S. Rogers, commander of U.S. Cyber Command is helping Johnson pave the way for a takeover. He outlined the manner in which control would be seized over our election system by the crooks currently in power, to create the illusion of a legitimate response to the threat they are currently concocting and placing into our collective psyche, ?it?s those evil Russians who want Trump.?Rogers said, ?If a probe were required to determine if the election was hacked,? the default organized crime operation of DHS would ?take the lead.? He elaborated, ?Were there concerns that they thought there were an issue that would call into question the result, [states] potentially would approach the federal government.? Such an event would be a Donald Trump victory.He continued outlining their little scheme, saying, ?The Department of Homeland ?Security? would likely have overall responsibility, they likely would turn to the FBI, us, and maybe one or two others, to say, ?Can we put together a team and harness the breadth of this knowledge and insight and capability that you have to come back with an assessment: Do we think the result is valid? Do we think it was manipulated in any way? So that?s how I think it would play out.?Of course the facts would have no bearing on any of those questions or responses beyond how they can be manipulated to the political advantage of Hillary Clinton and how it can be done without being any more obvious than necessary.It?s laughable that DHS, and the FBI that are obstructing the Clinton prosecution and ?maybe one or two others? is supposed to be a team that we trust to be unbiased and offer a fair investigation and a fair result. If these criminal organizations are involved in anything resembling electoral process insertion of themselves there is no doubt but what it is being done to steal the election.

'Tim Cook unveiled the new iPhone8, iPhone8 plus and iPhone 10 at the Apple Event held at Steve Jobs Theater on Tuesday.

The IT department conducted raids on all the people that pre-booked the new phones and in an interesting turn of events all of them were arrested for holding black money.We interviewed Mr. Suresh Jain, the head officer who conducted the raids and here?s what he had to say. ?We had signed a deal with all major e-commerce portals way before the release of the new iPhones. We told them to provide us with the details of all the people who pre-book the new iPhones on the first day itself. Now, if you regularly pay your taxes, do you think you would be able to afford a phone costing one lac? Most of the people in India live on EMIs. You dissect an Indian and you would find more EMIs than blood cells. So if someone is willing to pay an exorbitant price of one lac for a phone so over-rated that it puts Bhuvan Bam to shame, it is bound to arise suspicion right?? He further continued and said, ?So just like we planned we got the details, name ? phone number ? address, of all the people who pre-booked any one of the new iPhones and we conducted raids on all of them. And to our surprise our raid was 100\% successful. All these people had sources of black money stashed in their homes and offices. This was my debut raid as I joined this office just a month ago and I must say, my debut was even bigger than that of Hrithik Roshan.?

'After the election of Donald Trump as President of Russia, season 1 of IT Big Boss has started in India.Responding to queries from the ChutiyaRepublic TV about intentions of starting such a unique game show, the CEO of Tech M said, ?See an average Indian is quite smarter than their western counterparts, so this social experiment is to test their mental strength.We are analysing the outcomes by treating them like slaves with low salary & minimising their hikes.To maximise our show?s cost efficiency, they have to overwork freely.?The show?s concept is so impressive that even KRK requested to be a part of this new endeavour.Employees would be tasked with technical assignments which have nerve wrecking deadlines.In case of failure, they would be awarded a Maggi packet as a token of appreciation & fired instantly.Also, employees willing to donate their brains to foreign clients would be rewarded with extra points.An anonymous employee of Tech M said he is entirely joyful with the recent developments as it would make his life more adventurous like Salman Khan.As his variable pay has decreased, so he is quite optimistic about learning unique art forms of survival in frugal conditions.According to leaked reports, as prize money wildcard entry to the Automation?s Big Boss House would be arranged for all the finalists in season 1.Many IT companies have also played an early April Fool prank on recent hires by delaying their joining dates even after providing them with Job Offer letters.It seems that Big Boss wishes the young graduates to loose all their sense of self-esteem so that they would quickly abide by the rules of the game.Many economists like Superman & Rajnikanth have already given a standing ovation to the IT service companies for this brilliant strategy to improve their quarterly profits.But despite widespread allegations about layoffs because of the game shows, the HR executives are promoting it with a lot of enthusiasm.The spokesperson stated that it is the need of the hour to drive our employees to depression.After being in despair because of work environment, it seems entirely possible many of them might commit suicide.So in the long term, it would create more job openings.\r\r\n\r\nThe government has declined to intervene in this matter as a decrease in population would help in the overall growth of India.Meanwhile, Psychologists & Dhaba owners across the country are rejoicing with the new developments as it would lead to a spike in their businesses.Many parents quite concerned that their investment of 20 years aren?t paying off have approached the Prime Minister?s Office.The PMO office suspecting them to be JNU professors asked them to sing national anthem 108 times by standing on one foot as a pre-requisite condition to get job offers from Patanjali & Reliance Industries.',fake
'New Delhi- Information technology officials indicated that the coming days may see a transformative regulation in the way your email id was formed. While most people used their names in their email ids, or other words if they wanted to remain anonymous, the reality could be your Aadhar number will soon form your email id instead of your name or any other words.This means if your email id was [email?protected] or [email?protected] etc; the name or the words before the @ will be replaced with your Aadhar number. Assuming your Aadhar number is 11111111111, then your email id will now read as [email?protected] and so forth.While the officials declined to reveal further details and preferred to maintain anonymity, they mentioned three important reasons why this change is being effected.One ? it helps establish your true identity. With KYC norms becoming very stringent, and fighting cyber crimes a priority, it is critical to identify whose email id you are dealing with. Using the above example, thousands of other people may have names similar to you, or use adjectives like cooldude etc, that everybody claims to be anyways. But Aadhar number is a unique number, hence makes it easy to identify.Two ? it helps control access of piracy and porn content on the internet. Given that Swachh Bharat is a focus area, the cyber space in India should also be free of garbage, said the officials.Three ? it helps take digital marketing to the next level. Today is not the age of B2B or B2C, rather it is the age of B2I. This means Business to Individual. In such a situation, businesses across industries will get a clearer idea of the prospective customers they are addressing through digital marketing, since Aadhar number contains peoples? profile. Customers can also gain by getting right products pitched to them, instead of spam of unwanted products. However, the officials declined to comment if indeed peoples? profiles will be revealed to marketers.The officials said a cut-off date will be given- by when citizens will need to revise their existing email ids to reflect only their Aadhar number, or make new email ids with their Aadhar Number. This revised or new email id has to be updated in all the official places like banks and other service providers by that date. After that date, all other email ids inside India will become null-and-void, and customers will not be able to access those email ids any more.',fake
'John Bolton: Evidence has surfaced of yet more impropriety at the most corrupt agency of the federal government outside of the White House and DOJ, the State Department. Patrick Kennedy, one of only six Undersecretaries of State, made multiple offers to the FBI in an attempt to have the classified markings stripped from some emails.The State Department spokesliar, John Kirby, assumed the familiar position of denying any wrongdoing involving State Department employees, admitting?that Patrick Kennedy did discuss the classifications with the FBI, but it was merely for the purposes of clarification.\r\nFormer UN Ambassador John Bolton, who was once held the position of Undersecretary of State himself, labeled the events ?extraordinarily serious.? He says, ?The fact that the trade wasn?t made doesn?t detract from that, attempted bribery is just as much a crime as actual bribery.? Bolton compares what was happening in this instance with the selling of a Senate seat by former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, for which he went to prison.Bolton says, ?What Patrick Kennedy was trading here was slots for the FBI in American embassies overseas. It may not sound like much but in the bureaucracy that was golden too.? Bolton, having held the position as well himself, believes that Kennedy ?is really the circuit breaker between the State Department bureaucracy and Hillary Clinton.? Bolton believes he was communicating what was going on with Clinton and her staff, that they knew what was going on and if ?if they didn?t they were asleep at the switch.?Bolton becomes animated at this latest instance of blatant corruption within the administration, saying, ?This is attempted bribery. It is inconceivable to me that a State Department official could do this. You can?t change the classification of information, whether it?s a document or some other tangible form, for any reason other than a change in the circumstances that gave rise to the classification in the first place.??This Patrick Kennedy was doing a political task,? says Bolton, ?for Hillary Clinton, trading on government information and government resources, the slots in the overseas embassies. So this was bribery with your taxpayer assets at stake. It?s just, he should be removed from office. Certainly if I tried to do that I would have been removed.Hemmer asks if the unthinkable happens and the criminal wins in 21 days, ?What is the hangover from these allegations?? Bolton replies, ?I think it means that all of the questions about her conduct at the State Department continue. Remember, another aspect of Patrick Kennedy, he was deeply involved in Benghazi. He is the person who appointed the accountability review board that exonerated Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in connection with Benghazi and any incompetence without even every bothering to interview her.?Bolton adds, ?And the emails in question that he was trying to trade on were Benghazi related emails.

'Actor and patriot Jon Voight has an urgent plea for America, as he?tries to talk some sense into the masses who don?t realize what is happening. They are stumbling along mindlessly, unaware of the serious threat we are all under. The threat of globalism and the death of our nation, brought about with the election of Hillary Clinton. He says:My dear fellow Americans. We are all feeling tremendous anxiety with only a few weeks left until the election. This will be the most important election in American history. We were once a country of freedom and now we are becoming a country of tyranny. We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our cities, Ferguson, Missouri, Milwaukee, Orlando Florida, Baltimore.?We are all witness to our own people killing our policemen. Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and pretend all of the killings are not happening.How many Americans are aware of George Soros? An evil man who turned hundreds of Jewish people over to the Nazis to be exterminated during World War ll. He was interviewed on 60 Minutes and was asked does he feel guilty for what he has done. And arrogantly he said, ?Absolutely not. If I didn?t do it someone else would have.? Soros is a billionaire who made most of his money manipulating currencies and almost bankrupting many countries. He supports hate groups who are responsible for taking down our cities. And he is a close friend of Hillary Clinton and a major supporter of her campaign.Robert De Niro is a millionaire, as are so many of our Hollywood stars who are voting for Hillary and who have absolutely no tolerance for anyone of a different opinion, forgetting that that is what our country is founded on, freedom of choice. But they will not be affected by Hillary?s open borders. Only our poor and middle class will suffer. Thousands of refugees will flood our nation and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys.It will kill our economy, which is at an all-time low now under the years of Obama?s ?presidency.? And Hillary boasts of how proud she will be to continue Obama?s legacy. No one can afford health insurance now, prices for healthcare, gone through the roof thanks to Obamacare. Our once reasonable healthcare is gone.With Hillary as president we will lose our Second Amendment with our right to bear arms. Freedom of religion will be attacked. And Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. Our highest courts will become socialist and she will restrict what America was founded on, our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.She has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died and when their parents stood over their loved ones? coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons? deaths.The pendulum of freedom is not balanced. Hillary and her followers are on a crude campaign to stop and degrade all of Trump?s followers. Her words were echoed loud and clear for all Americans to hear. Hillary said Trump?s followers are a basket of deplorables, they are unredeemable. May God protect the real truth. And may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America. And he will certainly make it great again.',fake

Some people feel it?s completely over blown while some are horrified and are still dipping peroxide soaked Q-tips into their ear canals to regain their purity. She?s seems to be trying to find a midpoint from which she can help her audience get on to more important issues.She says, ?The statements are devastating, the words are disgusting, it is awful, it is the kind of language that none of us want to hear. But let me put this in perspective for you. It was eleven years ago with a man who was in television.

But the most important part of all of this is it was eleven years ago. We?ve now got a man who apologized and to some people it wasn?t a sufficient enough apology. Ok, I?m sure that he?s going to probably do more in the next 24 hours.?She says, ?But the bottom line is this. America?s in a mess, who do you want? Do you want a guy who?s got a past, who admits to you that he?s got a past, he didn?t plan to run for president?

And you know who should be furious right now? The Bernie Sanders supporters should be furious. They are the ones who got taken by Hillary Clinton.?She says Donald Trump needs to get aggressive, that he needs to show several sides of himself in the debate. He needs to show that he?s embarrassed and sorry but then turn it around into the fact that he didn?t plan to run for president and he?s the one who can fix our lives, that he?s doing it for the country and really doesn?t ?need this crap,? to be honest.

'Mumbai: I get, that concerts, especially the ones with international caliber, are expensive.

That, some would still justify, and a lot of the audiences got the chance of experiencing the band for free; courtesy of the Global Citizen.Teekhi Mirchi did a survey that time and found that half the Indians thought Coldplay was a cough syrup, while other half thought it?s a newly launched Patanjali Cola cold drink.But 76,000 INR for Justin Bieber India concert, are you kidding me? That?s not even the monthly income of most of the households in India. RBI has taken a strong step in curbing this nuance. According to the latest guidelines, RBI has set the withdrawal limit from ATM to 100 INR per day, so that the youth cannot conjure up to 76000 to pay for the concert.

'Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a MASTER at the news and media game. ?On Sunday night in St. Louis, he proved it yet again. According to Neil Cavuto of Fox News, the pool of media people who follow Trump around were led to believe that they were headed to the Four Seasons for a photo op. ?Instead, they got a live press conference with The Donald and three of Bill Clinton?s rape victims as well as the victiom of child rape who Hillary Clinton laughed off: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Kathy Shelton and Paula Jones. ?(Thanks to Gateway Pundit.)From a few blocks away, in the midst of the land of the moonbats, the Limits household stood and cheered.As it happens, the Four Seasons here in St. Louis is about eight miles from where the debate is happening, north of the Arch on the Mississippi River. ?In good traffic, it?s about twenty-five minutes away. ?From the photograph, if the room is not the Four Seasons, it looks a lot like the Knight Center, which is a conference center on the campus of Washington University where the debate is happening. ?(Could also be the Ritz, which is down the street.) ?Plain and simply, the press got punked, and the Clinton campaign ? and the DC Uniparty ? was outplayed.Consider the locker room talk audio tape neutralized, and the gloves off. ?Trump is now playing hardball. ?Not only that, dirty mouth talk is NOTHING to legitimate rape. ?Nothing. ?We the People know that. ?So do the media. ?And tonight, our alpha male candidate for president made sure everyone out there knows it, too.Bravo, Mr. Trump. ?It?s not that often that we get to see someone with brass ones go up against the Clintons and not end up on an internet list. ?We the People are enjoying this.',fake

It is possible that the women accusing him of this, that or the other thing were rejected in some way by him. Yes, women will make up stuff like that. In addition, yet more Podesta emails demonstrate that at least some of the accusations were planned months in advance.

Such was the response to the trailer that it broke even Baahubali 2?s record. One thing missing from the trailer though was expressions on Katrina Kaif?s face. And even Katrina realized it and conveyed the reason for the same.According to Katrina, she has worked extra hard for her role in Tiger Zinda Hai, in fact she has spoken total of 2 dialogues in the movie which is way higher than her previous films. She even tried to act in this movie which is a big challenge in itself. Known for here pretty face, Katrina?s expression are the last thing people watch on screen, but after so many failed attempts at acting, no one is willing to spare her incapabilities. But Katrina has taken the criticism in her strides and come out with a logical reason for the flaw. According to her, most of the viewership for the trailer was generated from North India which is facing severe smog due to which her expressions were not clearly visible to the audience on their phones, laptops and other gadgets.Katrina has assured the fans that once they watch it again after the winter months, they will realize that she has actually improved as an actor and will give her due credit for her hard work. Yashraj has even promised to come up with a new trailer which will only highlight Katrina?s expressions because any ways Bhai doesn?t give many expressions himself.

'John Kerry is attempting to convince the American people that the Russians are behind the WikiLeaks document dumps and the hacks which are exposing the hypocrisy, deceit, bad intentions, crimes and treason of Hillary Clinton. While critical, he hasn?t said that the contents of the WikiLeaks documents aren?t genuine. He knows they?re legit or he would have long ago made that point through one of his spokespersons.For some reason they?ve decided that claiming the Russians are guilty of provocation and possible interference provides them with the best way of protecting their corrupt little operation. Kerry and the regime are rapidly ticking up the rhetoric with Russia over both the situation in Syria and the November elections. There is no shortage of bad men on the planet doing evil things. What is it about Assad and his country that make it such an obsession with the Obama globalists? What do they really want to arrange before the elections or before Obama is turned out?Kerry is now threatening Putin, both regarding Syria and Aleppo as well as warning that the US will retaliate if Russia meddles in our election. They are putting the idea into everybody?s head that Russia poses such a real threat that the regime is willing to go to war over it. Of course they?re even more likely to go to war over illegitimate non-threats that offer personal enrichment opportunities.Kerry engaged in some incoherent tough guy talk, saying, ?We released this information to put the people doing it on a notice that they?re not, quote, ?getting away with it? for free, as well as to put states on notice that we?re serious when we say they need to take every measure possible to guarantee the integrity of our elections. And we will and can respond in ways that we choose to at the time of our choice.? He made his meandering comments Monday at The Internet Association?s Virtuous Cycle Conference.Obama made the same kind of statement the previous day, an indication that they are up to something. Coordinated messages are a preferred method of preparing the citizenry for an imminent Obama abuse. Kerry put on his ?it?s different when we do it hat,? saying, ?What makes the Russian thing so different is that I don?t think any of us engaged previously in democratic exercise where we actually tried to change the votes somehow by co-opting the counting process.? He may have found a niche that we have yet to exploit, it?s doubtful, but it?s a totally meaningless distinction. There is no disputing America?s long history of intervention in foreign elections and regime change.Kerry then addressed the topic but not specifics of actions by the Obama regime to intervene in the elections in other nations, such as Israel where Obama sent Alinsky style operatives in an operation called V15 to organize an opposition against Netanyahu. He admitted the US has tried to ??affect outcomes? of foreign elections, but argued for a distinction between American information-sharing and direct hacks. Nice sounding names make everything all better.The rest of his comments were more of the sort of aimless ramblings of somebody who has no chance of talking his way sensibly out of the jam he?s in, who babbles as a defense to confuse everybody into losing track of where they were and how he started his paragraph.Kerry proclaimed, ?But that said, this ain?t the first time countries, ours included, have tried to affect outcomes of governments or ? in one part of the world or another. I mean, go back to Iran in 1953 when Mosaddegh was run out by the CIA and Kermit Roosevelt and ? we were engaged in changing government, or Diem in Vietnam when we ? so there?s a history of involvement. And some people argue to me as secretary of state when I visit their countries that legitimate national institutions of ours like the National Democratic Institute or the International Republican Institute are engaged in that kind of activity.?He added, ?People are in fact trying to close down the legitimate exchange of ideas, which is not what the Russians were engaged in, but we had engaged in the legitimate exchange of ideas and they label it ?interference? in their campaign, which is the difference.??And that?s one of the reasons why we wanted to make clear people understood that distinction, because we don?t do those old things that used to happen. That is not a government role and it?s been, I think, for some period of time not something that we?re engaged in.?How long ago was Obama, Clinton and McCain?s little adventure in Ukraine, Kerry? Was that before or after Obama stopped doing ?those old things?? Was Libya before or after? Egypt? And opposing Britain?s vote to leave the EU, Obama?

'Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni?s love affair with Chennai continues and it was once again evident when the India wicket-keeper came out to bat during the first ODI against Australia in Chennai on Sunday. But if I tell you that Dhoni?s contribution with the bat won us the match, it would be an insult to the man?s leadership abilities. In the second innings, it was his quick decision making which relieved Kohli off the burden to make decisions as Captain.After letting go captaincy of the ODI team, there were doubts about Dhoni?s place in the ODI set up. But some of his recent performances have put a lid on those openings. In fact, his captaincy skills are still used by India. And yesterday it was relevant enough to say so, after hearing dozens of small clippings through the stump microphone running parallel with match commentary. At each and every juncture where the bowlers were losing their line, Dhoni was quick to transfer tips, change fields, talk to the bowlers and almost every thing that a captain does.In fact the only contribution of Virat Kohli in yesterday?s match was the toss. After that it was pure Dhoni. We have to give credit to the commentator who anchored the presentation ceremony as he could have easily announced Dhoni?s name instead of Kohli?s for having a after-match chat, but he avoided that mistake. Looking at the vast experience MSD carries, Kohli has requested the BCCi to keep all the stump mic recordings in a safe place. These pieces of of information will help him in captaining the side once Dhoni retires. The recordings will also be used by IIMs across the nation to teach leadership skills to management students, HRD minister Prakash Javdekar was heard saying at a press conference.',fake
'Cover image is of Mother Angelica, the founder of EWTN, or the Catholic Channel.So far, all of the information coming out from the John Podesta emails provided by Wikileaks talked about politics and finding ways to influence public opinion. ?Now, the cache of information is revealing another target: The Catholic Church.In an email exchange with a Jew, Sandy Newman, Podesta talks about planting the seeds of a ?Catholic Spring? and fomenting revolution against the bishops in order to ?Democratize? the Church:?There needs to be a Catholic Spring, in which Catholics themselves demand the end of a middle ages dictatorship and the beginning of a little democracy and respect for gender equality in the Catholic Church,? Sandy Newman, president and founder of the progressive nonprofit Voices for Progress, writes to Podesta in an email titled ?opening for a Catholic Spring? just musing.???Even if the idea isn?t crazy, I don?t qualify to be involved and I have not thought at all about how one would ?plant the seeds of the revolution,? or who would plant them.???We created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this. But I think it lacks the leadership to do so now. Likewise Catholics United. Like most Spring movements, I think this one will have to be bottom up,? Podesta writes?.The conversation further reveals the contempt with which radical progressives view Catholics and the Catholic Church.As if we Catholics didn?t know that. ?The Church has been attacked by all sides since the first century when a Roman named Simon tried to infiltrate the teachings. ?It didn?t work then and it?s not going to work now. ?The Church has never been a democracy, but always a confederation of bishoprics. ?In 2,000 years, we?ve even had popes worse than Francis, and we survived the worst apostate Cardinal of the twentieth century, even if Francis is trying to breathe life into that man?s dead heretical theology. ?All revolution at this point will do is get a bunch of people excommunicated for heresy. ?Public opinion rarely sways the hierarchy ? especially on the topic that they were discussing. ?The Lifezette article quoted above didn?t give the reason for the exchange. ?Breitbart did:This whole controversy with the bishops opposing contraceptive coverage even though 98\% of Catholic women (and their conjugal partners) have used contraception has me thinking . . .Mr. Newman shouldn?t think too hard since that number is not accurate. ?It was debunked some time ago, and includes the abstinence numbers. ?Not only that, the Church teaching on contraception comes not from the bishops, but is eternal, and the reason why was best explained by Pope Paul VI in 1968 via the encyclical that reinforced the teaching, Humanae Vitae:Consequences of Artificial Methods17. Responsible men can become more deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings?and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation?need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.Finally, careful consideration should be given to the danger of this power passing into the hands of those public authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral law. Who will blame a government which in its attempt to resolve the problems affecting an entire country resorts to the same measures as are regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty? Who will prevent public authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which they consider more effective? Should they regard this as necessary, they may even impose their use on everyone. It could well happen, therefore, that when people, either individually or in family or social life, experience the inherent difficulties of the divine law and are determined to avoid them, they may give into the hands of public authorities the power to intervene in the most personal and intimate responsibility of husband and wife.No matter what one thinks of the Catholic Church or Catholicism, if the bishops were to bend on this ? even with the threat on the mission of the Church being made via economic blackmail ? then the Church has no moral authority whatsoever. ?She is not a democracy. ?She is also not a dictatorship, of the middle ages or any other time period. ?She is the Church, the oldest institution on earth. ?And we Catholics know darn well and good that the apostates have been steadily hammering away from inside the faith far more effectively than any ?Catholic spring seeds? ever could.',fake

'Okay, so the email in question, written by Bill Ivey at Global Cultural Strategies to Clinton Campaign guy John Podesta, and found in one of the Wikileaks dumps over the weekend, didn?t say ?keep the populace stupid? in those words. ?But it did talk about keeping We the People in the dark, and manipulating public opinion by presenting information as the Clinton campaign and the surrounding apparatus would like the world to know it in order to keep us all under control. Read:And as I?ve mentioned, we?ve all been quite content to demean government, drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry. The unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly. This problem demands some serious, serious thinking ? and not just poll driven, demographically-inspired messaging.What Ivey, Bill Clinton?s Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, was expressing to Podesta was the challenge in fighting a celebrity-driven campaign, as Donald Trump?s is still seen to be. ?That sort of campaign, Ivey lamented, was actually identified by John F. Kennedy, Jr., in his short-lived publication, ?George.? ?This is the sort of campaign that would ultimately by-pass all efforts of the leftist propaganda machine. ?In the case of Trump, though, the Clintons came up against a formidable opponent who worked to reverse just about all of their work.Well, we all thought the big problem for our US democracy was Citizens United/Koch Brothers big money in politics. Silly us; turns out that money isn?t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process. Trump masters TV, TV so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas, free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we?re off and running.Marvelous, isn?t it?Trump?s ?hair brained ideas? happen to jive, align and otherwise dovetail with what the American people were all concluding at the same time he was starting to develop in-depth policy papers on the topics that concern us all. ?Obamacare IS a disaster for the people and the country. ?We DO want some sort of secure border between the southern states and Mexico. ?Manufacturing jobs HAVE left the country in droves since NAFTA was signed. ?Veterans ARE getting the shaft and shoddy care. ?The list goes on and on.How does this get handled in the general? Secretary Clinton is not an entertainer, and not a celebrity in the Trump, Kardashian mold; what can she do to offset this? I?m certain the poll-directed insiders are sure things will default to policy as soon as the conventions are over, but I think not.To an extent, We the People all knew this was happening, and now we know there was a concerted effort to depress the air of patriotism among the people in order to keep us all under control. ?To what end?theft of rights, prosperity, freedoms ? any or all of the above. ?This is known as manipulation of public opinion, and, yes, the fake media polls that all the pundits use to bolster their narrative are part of it.',fake
'New Delhi: Many TV audiences have written to News Broadcasters Association (NBA) complaining about news anchors missing from their TV screen, possibly from studios when the debate is on.Sandeep Singh, an avid news watcher who is attempting this year civil services examination for the sixth time is upset with this latest trend. While speaking to us, he said, ?There are news anchors who are paid much more than the first citizen of India, i.e. President. When they themselves decide the topic beforehand, choose their panelists and put hashtags to advertise them, why they cannot be present full time to encourage the fighting spirit displayed by their panelists.??Though I do not understand much from the ?discussion?, I just watch it for my daily relaxation. I have noticed as long as anchor is there, he tries to bring the debate back on track as panelists always try to derail it and go as per their convenience. Once anchor is not there, the panelists speak whatever they want. Sometimes I am afraid some panelist might hit other one during live discussion. That would be a sad day,? said Sandeep.?That?s why I have requested NBA to come with a guideline on mandatory presence of anchors all through the debate. No running away in between to do some last-minute shopping because your spouse asked for it or pick your kid from some guitar or dancing classes,? said Sandeep.Sandeep added, ?Agree no one can sit through full three hours, more so if you smoke or need a cup of coffee to recharge your throats. Utilize the breaks properly, if needed have extended breaks.?In the meantime, a news anchor after the break when he re-joined the debate, found two panelists have completely reversed their ?roles?. ?For convenience of our viewers, we display on screen who is going to say in support of the topic and who against it. These two panelists have reversed their positions. It was all chaos. My training before the program went for a toss, now I have to do it again tomorrow with a new group,? said the anchor.',fake

The goverment has now come into rescue mode and has finally found the reason behind this mass IT layoff.According to India?s IT lobby NASSCOM, Indian liberals and human rights activists are responsible for this mess, Indian government has nothing to do with it, economy is doing just fine, and there is nothing to worry about?at least for now.This latest declaration is in line with the stand taken by government supporter trolls on social media, and India?s mainstream media, who blame Indian liberals for every other problem related to government failure; from riots to Pakistan beheading our soldiers, to Maoist violence and so on.As the news of this latest condemnable act by liberals and human rights activists spread, Indian mainstream media took a dig at them. Times Now news channel, which is stuggling to raise its tempo even further, thanks to recent Arnab breakup, labasted at liberals and tweeted:Indian IT professionals losing IT jobs, liberal league takes Sunday off?

'Sportswriters on the National Football League beat have been spinning and denying the elephant in the room on the great 2016 NFL ratings drop all season. ?The demise of the value of advertising space on broadcasts is being blamed on competition from the election, boring play, blowouts, Payton Manning retiring, Tom Brady missing four games, bad officiating?you name it.Finally, at the quarterly owners meeting, the BIG MONEY people are acknowledging that maybe, just maybe, there?s a real image problem with Colin Kaepernick?s little temper tantrum, and the resulting cascade of players who don?t respect the rest of us.Then there are the protests. The national anthem protests by players, ignited by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick?s mission to raise awareness about police brutality and social justice inequalities that victimize African Americans, has been a polarizing debate of its own on the NFL?s grand stage. Though?the protests ? from players like Kaepernick taking a knee, to players raising a fist, to players and coaches locking arms in unity ? end when the games begin, they generate much discussion before and after the contests.Still, the impact of the protests illustrates the power of the NFL?s reach.?I think it?s the wrong venue,? Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay told USA TODAY Sports. ?It hasn?t been a positive thing. What we all have to be aware of as players, owners, PR people, equipment managers, is when the lights go on we are entertainment. We are being paid to put on a show. There are other places to express yourself.?Irsay?s view is undoubtedly shared by other owners who frown on the protests drawing attention from their product. Given the intense backlash against Kaepernick, it?s plausible that people have turned away to protest the protests.?People come to the game because they want to get away from what?s happening in their everyday lives,? McNair said. ?When you bring those types of things into the scene, yeah, it will turn some people off. But the main thing we try to do is to say, ?We recognize your concern. Let?s do something about it.? ?The writer of the USA Today article, Jarrett Bell, is really in some sort of state of denial still.It?s striking that the anthem protests, connected to other factors, are?viewed as a variable that seemingly runs deeper than other recent crises. The NFL took tremendous PR hits with its domestic violence issues and concerns about the effects of concussions. But those serious issues seemingly didn?t have a major effect on the ratings.Other bad publicity issues didn?t insult the fan base by stomping on patriotism. ?That?s the problem that the NFL won?t acknowledge, that their gaslighted players are following memes and narratives that the American people, and the fan base, either do not buy, or see from the other side. ?That?s why this year?s ratings look like this against last year?s.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique Hits \r\n',fake

'Lou Dobbs addresses the escalating problem of voter fraud, the engineered problem that Republicans failed to stop as the obvious manipulations of the system by Democrats were being carried out. He notes that in the State of Indiana, the State Police are investigating voter registration fraud in 56 of the state?s 92 counties. They?re focusing on a DC based liberal voter mobilization group called ?Patriot Majority USA,? though the likelihood of there being anything patriotic about their operations is extremely remote.Dobbs notes how in the State of Virginia there were 1,000 illegal aliens registered to vote between 2008 and 2012. They?re also looking into at least 20 application in Virginia which were filed using the names of dead people.He also points out that forty illegals were discovered having voted in recent elections in Philadelphia and seven involving dead voters being registered in Colorado in the last 8 years. Lou Dobbs notes that Donald Trump has been warning ever since this race started that it was rigged and the proof is being realized now.Ed Rollins notes that the states that Dobbs identified are key swing states, with it being apparent that the Democrats have a master plan for fraud and the Republicans do not have one to match it for prevention. It?s an interesting statement to the lack of moral character of the Democrats that cheating on their part is a given that is not even surprising anymore and that Republicans are presumed to be honest and the ones who will be giving chase to the outlaws.Dobbs asks again what the Republicans are doing about the problem and meets Rollins? silence with the question, ?Can the Republican Party be any more screwed up?? That question was easier for Rollins to answer, ?I don?t think so.?Dobbs notes how following up the 2008 and 2012 losses with the suicidal betrayals of Paul Ryan is madness. He goes on to display his total frustration and disgust with Congress and the totally corrupt system in place in DC, one that is well on its way to finishing off this nation.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'An increasingly thoroughly disgusted Lou Dobbs says, ?You could not make anything that is happening in this country these days, you could not make it up. A few thoughts now on Hillary Clinton and those who drive the Clinton Cartel from the Near East desk of the State Department to the office of John Kerry himself to the Clinton Foundation to the Justice Department to the FBI to the White House. The stench of broken trust and public corruption fills the dank, heavy air of our capital.??Despite what you may be told by the Clintons and their accomplices and co-corrupters,? says Dobbs, ?There are few accidents and seldom any coincidences in the dark, secretive Clinton realm of power. There is most often only careful calculation and orchestrated lies and deceit.??In a monumental Irony,? Dobbs says, ?the search for truth hidden by and behind the rotting bureaucracy of our federal government has been chiefly aided by the relentless stream of emails, documents and secretive speeches given by Mrs. Clinton, all now revealed ? by WikiLeaks. The WikiLeaks releases confirm without exception that the Clinton cartel will do anything to hide the truth from Americans, giving life to the axiom she stated in a 2013 speech saying, ?you need both a public and a private position.?Dobbs observes that perhaps neither is the truth, noting that one aide under Clinton proposed a bribe to the FBI in order to make a problem go away by declassifying an email from the illegal Clinton server. ?He notes that somehow the Clinton State Department still remains in the Obama administration, calling it a government within a government.?Dobbs is dumbfounded by not only the fact that the bribe was attempted but that there was a sufficient level of confidence in the pervasive corruption that the aide was comfortable in the attempt. He notes she simply refused a federal judge?s order to respond to 18 of 25 questions regarding her corruption. That?s an indictment on the judiciary as well and on the previously well-respected and highly regarded Judge, Emmett Sullivan.?Dobbs points out that the only reason we know about the bribe attempted between two departments of the Obama administration is the FBI apparently learned from WikiLeaks and simply posted these illuminating and incriminating documents on the FBI webpage.?He?d like to think Director Comey developed some integrity and ordered the information posted.

'Bangalore. Intrigued by a WhatsApp message two years ago, a man in Bangalore set out to investigate and find the author of the message to congratulate him/her. He started asking in all the WhatsApp groups he was present, if anyone knew the author of the post. No one seemed to know. He continued his search for two years as was learnt by Faking News.After asking in the WhatsApp groups, he started asking in all the other social media including Facebook. What he unraveled was the truth about social media that what is viral in one App or website does not even have a reference in the other rival sites. There was absolutely nothing social about them or between them.Later, he sought after technical help and even contacted a few ethical and some unethical hacking companies for the investigation. Nothing helped. His search soon became very difficult as it was nearly impossible to find the owner of a message in WhatsApp,?technically hacking or socially asking.The message once intrigued him by the sheer brilliance of its content, started haunting him, with a question, ?Who said it!? The words were written in a manner as though the author knew him for years. It was a tailor-made guiding light for his future, destined to reach him in WhatsApp.By this unaccomplished mission, his behavior over the two years had changed. He became more aloof, in severe contrast to the advice from the message. His wife at home initially took his strange behavior in the last 24 months as ?office tension?. When he started talking to himself, she had had enough and finally asked him ?what in the world is going on??, avoiding the word hell; nevertheless stressing on a? tone that would mean nothing but hell.With much hesitation he shared details about his mission from 2 years. She grabbed his mobile and saw it. Seeing the message, the lady laughed out loud and admitted it was her who wrote and posted it in her school mom?s group. Both the man and the woman had requested Faking News to keep their identity secret and the message not be shared in the mainstream media.',fake

'Today is October 23, 2016 and most Americans will wake this morning and go about another routine day spending time with their family and friends. For the Marines, family members and loved ones of The Battalion Landing Team, 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment their day will not be so care free. The Marines of the Battalion Landing Team will wake for the 33rd year with the memories of the worst day and experience of their lives. The date October 23rd and the time 0622 is a date and time they will never forget.For those of you too young to remember and those of you who have allowed time to let the memory of that date and time fade over the years, on October 23, 1983 at 0622 a 19-ton yellow Mercedes-Benz truck, loaded with 21,000 pounds of TNT, slammed into the four-story concrete building, that hundreds of Marines called home. In an instant the explosion took the lives of 241 of America?s finest.Moments before 0622, the Sergeant of the Guard recalls hearing the revving of an engine behind him, this was the yellow truck packed full of explosives that had crashed through a 5-foot-high barrier of concertina wire and was speeding toward their guard post on the perimeter of the Marine Barracks. The Sergeant of the Guard, Sgt. Stephen Russell, recalls the truck passing so close to him that he was able to look directly into the eyes of the crazed truck driver, who smiled at him as he sped past toward the Marine Barracks.Sgt. Russell began yelling ?HIT THE DECK, HIT THE DECK!? Most Marine guard post providing security in a combat zone would be manned by heavily armed Marines. Back in 1983 that would have included perhaps an M60 or a .50 Cal., something that may have been able to render a vehicle inoperable. Not in Beirut though, America?s diplomats thought the Marines would better serve their objectives by being peacekeepers.As the yellow truck loaded with 21,000 pounds of TNT sped toward and past them they instinctively did what Marines are trained to do. As they quickly raised their weapons intent on engaging the truck in an attempt to stop or slow it down, they realized they had to load their weapons?something they were only allowed to do if being directly engaged. Only one Marine, LCpl Eddie DiFranco managed to load and chamber a round. By that time the truck was already crashing into the building.Sgt. Russell recalls seeing the truck crash into the building after speeding past them and coming to a complete stop in the center of the Marine Barracks lobby. ?I saw the truck come to a stop, dead center of that lobby? Dead silence in the lobby, you could hear a pin drop,? says Sgt. Russell, who then thought to himself, ?son of a bitch, he did it!? The next thing he describes seeing was a big orange flash!The big orange flash Sgt. Russell saw, was the largest non-nuclear explosion since WWII. The blast created by 21,000 pounds of TNT literally leveled the four-story building the Marines had called home. There were about 300 service members living in the building. The blast claimed the lives of 241. 220 were Marines, 18 Navy personnel, and 3 Army soldiers. This was the deadliest attack against US Marines since the battle over Iwo Jima in February 1945.Last year I had some Marines and family members contribute some personal stories that I published and I will share them again this year. Since last year something has happened that I was about to call interesting, but frankly it ticks me off.I doubt many Americans are aware of this, but in 2001 about 812 family members sued the government of Iran for directing the bombing of the Marine Barracks by Hezbollah extremist. The families were successful in obtaining a multibillion-dollar recovery in the case, Peterson v. Islamic Republic of Iran.On April 20, 2016 almost three years after a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Citibank to turn over $1.9 billion in frozen Iranian Central Bank assets, the U.S. Supreme Court finally cleared the way for the assets to be distributed to the plaintiffs.In spite of the highest court in the land approving the release of Iranian funds to pay the judgment to the Marines, to the best of my knowledge none of them have been paid. What irks me about this is that Obama just turned billions of dollars over to the Iranians that should have been used to pay judgment to these families. Obama used some excuse about it being their money and if we had not given it back, they ?might? have sought a judgment against the US in international court.It?s just my humble opinion, but everyone of these families and Marines that were part of the lawsuit that obtained the judgment against Iran should have been paid BEFORE Iran ever received a dime!The Marines and families of the Beirut casualties did not have all of the resources and support available to them that our wounded warriors do involved in the War on Terror today. Hell, a lot of the country had no clue the Marines were even there. I try to write something on the Beirut bombing every year because in recent years they are not even mentioned by the main stream media. We should NEVER forget those who have sacrificed for our nation, most of all those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice!Thoughts?',fake

The 1 million user base matrimonial website is now coming up with an ?Add To Cart? option. You can choose your life partner and add them to cart and get them delivered to your house after checking out.The CEO of barbaadi.com, Mr. Mangal Kumar, was available for an interview on Skype. Here?s what he had to say about this breakthrough feature, ?It is a known fact that e-commerce sites have add to cart option. All of us shop on them and get various items delivered to our house. So this one day, I was ordering the book ?How To Get A Girlfriend? from Amazon as it had a 95\% discount. I know you wouldn?t believe it.. but yes.. I AM single. Owner of a matrimonial site being single is like a bakery owner having sugar deficiency. Anyway, when I saw ?Add To Cart? option on the site, a bulb glowed inside my head. I thought why not add this feature and similar other features of e-commerce sites that people love to use, to my matrimonial site. I gathered my tech team and we discussed the features.? Speaking about the features, he added, ?So the new site will have an ?Add To Cart? option. You can browse through the options (Boys/Girls) and add the ones you like in cart. If their bio matches your interest and if you feel that this is the right person, you can order that person and we will deliver him/her to your home. You can choose from various options with many filters such as city, height, color, income, Milind Soman lookalikes (for women) and Chitrangada Singh lookalikes (for men). You can also request to us if you want a particular person with same income but different height or a person with different figure but same caste. Also, plenty of customization options will be available. Moreover, we would offer a 7 day free trial for those who want to just know the other person or have an engagement. We will also offer cash on delivery option to those who have been deceived earlier by someone?s profile picture. For those who are sure of marriage or as I like to call them ?desperate for sex?, we will offer card payments. We are closing our former website familypressure.com and we will make sure we redirect the traffic on familypressure.com to barbaadi.com.?By adding this feature, Mangal has surely gained a competitive advantage over his competitors.

'Chennai. The producers of the Diwali release Tamil movie ?Mersal?, Sri Thenandal Films, has profoundly thanked both BJP and Congress for the success of the film. The extraordinary box office collection and the publicity worldwide & in India, across all the news channels and the other media, would not have been possible if it is not for the two national political parties fighting against each other, the producers told Faking News.Initially, the protest started from a few Tamilnadu BJP leaders against a few scenes in the movie where the protagonist, actor Vijay, speaks badly about Indian GST, compared to that of Singaporean tax system. The leaders accused that Vijay has political ambitions and his remarks in the movie are wrong and politically motivated. Then the national level leaders joined in. ?It is only after OfficeOfRG tweeted about Mersal and against the PM, we see the highest box office collection? the producers told Faking News.?Free publicity is what all the movie produces long for after every movie release. Do you know that we spend about 25\% of the movie?s budget on the promotions alone. When Mersal hashtag runs across all the news channels, local and national, we are overjoyed.

'Michael Savage Presents Evidence The Media Wants You To STAY HOME on 11/08/16Michael Savage comments on a WikiLeaks document drop that shows collusion between the Clinton campaign and the media to try and take out any opposition. He says, ?That is something that was done and is done only in third-world dictatorships.Michael Savage notes that the US Navy is launching strikes against targets in Yemen after their failed attempts to sink three of our ships, but the media is bombarding us with incessant reporting that Donald Trump said some really naughty things.Is that what you?re supposed to worry about? Now the old hags are amazingly coming out of the woodwork to accuse him of groping them, groping them so many years ago. Why is it happening now? How come the very same offended media types had nothing to say when Bill Clinton was accused of raping several women and having many affairs right in the Oval Office?? He asks similar questions about the legendary womanizing of John F. Kennedy and about Ted ?the drunk? Kennedy, who left Mary Jo Kopechne to drown after he ran a road and into a pond on ?Chappaquiddick Island. He was still revered later as the ?Lion of the Senate? in spite of having cowardly run off and left the dying woman until she was discovered the following day.Pointing to the hypocrisy of the left, Savage says, ?You see the world is burning and it?s about to get worse. And we have a choice, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. Who do you trust most with the country at this critical moment? He notes that many of his listeners have become disheartened because of the piling on that is taking place, ?by the lowest of the human species, the Wolf Blitzers, the Jake Tappers. I can name them all, it doesn?t matter what I say about them, they are paid operatives of the Democrat socialist machine.??They are leading you to believe that the election is already over,? says Savage. ?They want you to believe that Trump can?t win. They want to dishearten you so that you don?t even vote because they know that the entire election hinges upon the voter turnout. Democrats understand that, that?s why they?re working the crowds.?He continues, ?That?s why they?re working the gutters, that?s why they?re working the prisons, that?s why they?re working the swamps. That?s why the demon in the White House is flooding America with illegal aliens. That?s why they?ve eliminated voter ID, in order to get voter turnout for the most corrupt, criminal woman to have ever gotten this close to the White House.??And what they want you to feel is that it?s over and you can?t win so why vote, while the exact opposite is true. Not only must you vote, you must actually get out the vote,? says Savage. ?You must speak to others on the other side of the aisle, those of you who understand what is at stake. And you must tell them that everything is at stake, because the Democrats are practicing a scorched earth policy on America.?He adds, ?And should she win, all Hell will break loose in this nation.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake

He pulled two women wearing Hijabs out of line ahead of me. When I came level to him, he was examining their voter registration cards and appeared to be attempting to direct them to another polling place. He seemed polite but I did not like that he?d singled out those two women?When I finished voting, there were two polling officials that were asking him to leave. He was refusing. He then entered the polling place, presumably to attempt to obtain permission to remain.According to the witness, the man doing the questioning of the women did not have any identification visible that he was an official with the elections commission, any campaign or any other authority. ?A different witness came forward later claiming that the same man was questioning a black man asking what precinct he was registered in.The Ingham County elections authority took action.Fox reported the incident to Barb Byrum, the Ingham County Clerk, who told Mother Jones that she considered the incident ?targeting individuals and harassing them and trying to convince them that they shouldn?t be voting.? She said the East Lansing city clerk reported the incident to the police. ?It doesn?t pass the smell test?so it needed to be addressed by law enforcement,? Byrum said.Fox?s brother Alan, a member of the Ingham County Board of Canvassers, said the local Democratic Party sent poll watchers to the synagogue following the report. According to Ron Fox, his brother said that ?presumably this was to ensure the person in question, or others did not return.?

'It?s some seedy activity, a common thing for Democrat politicians. Almost half a million dollars went to a campaign that didn?t even exist before sugar daddy Terry McAuliffe came up with the idea to use it as a means of funneling bribe money. The Virginia governor, a longtime Clinton ally, obviously coordinated with the Executive branch in providing a campaign fund for Dr. Jill McCabe as well as a promotion for her husband. In that position he had oversight of the investigation into the criminality of Hillary Clinton. Once Mr. McCabe was in his new elevated position following the payment of the cash, all he had to do was carry out his part of the deal, the sale of his position and influence in a manner that would make Hillary Clinton and Obama proud, and with it, his supposed integrity.Judge Napolitano explains that, while there might not be anything technically illegal with what was done, it smells bad, even rank, of corruption and conflict of interest. He said, ?Well, no, it is not against the law, I mean under Virginia law Governor McAuliffe can make contributions of that magnitude, from a variety of entities that he controlled to Dr. McCabe.? He notes that also under the law, ?Andrew McCabe, as the number two person in the FBI, can supervise the investigation of Mrs. Clinton.?Having dispensed with the technical, Napolitano say, ?But there is the appearance of impropriety. There is the appearance that he was aware of the relationship of Terry McAuliffe to the Clintons and that makes it look like his decisions would be colored by his wishes to please the people that are behind the person who gave this money to his wife.? The good judge goes out of his way to tiptoe around the obvious.Asked what McCabe should have done, Napolitano says, ?He should have excused himself from the case, because as a lawyer, he has the duty to avoid the ?appearance of impropriety? and the appearance of impropriety here is profound.? Napolitano notes that ?we learned this had happened from a tip from several FBI agents who were part of the team that had investigated Mrs. Clinton, who believe that their work was destroyed by management in the FBI.? He adds, ?We really have a situation here that looks terrible.?Governor John Sununu describes what happened as another defining example of the culture of corruption that the Clintons have brought to the Democrat Party for the last quarter century. Since 1992 they?ve infused this culture of corruption and it is now reaching into the FBI, which used to be one of the most hallowed and respected institutions in the US government.Sununu describes her denial of any impropriety absolute garbage and notes that while no law may have been technically broken, there is indisputable corruption. Bill Hemmer notes the campaign, which the wife lost, totaled approximately $1.8 million dollars. Sununu agrees that it is a lot of money for a state office seat and points out that almost half of it was funded by the Clintons. ?And you don?t think they?re planning ahead in how to influence the process? This is corruption in the Democrat Party. This election has to be an election of change and throwing out this party that has, even the ?president? of the United States today was nurtured and promoted by the corrupt political system in Chicago.?Sununu failed to make another point, one that ties in with the corruption of the occupier of the Oval Office, the promotion of McCabe was an Obama decision that required his authorization. Therefore his corruption is also on display once again as well.Napolitano makes another point, that the Governor is also under investigation by the FBI and it is very likely that that investigation as well is tainted by the corruption of both Director Comey and Assistant Director McCabe.',fake
'On the eve of the 2016 presidential election, Fox News is reporting some explosive information on the September 11, 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, were killed. ?It seems that the contractor hired to do security at the facility did not vet their employees like tried and true American companies would have done, and ended up with a bunch of terrorists ?guarding? the American compound.The explosive charge against Wales-based Blue Mountain Group comes from several sources, including an independent security specialist who has implemented training programs at U.S. Consulates around the world, including in Benghazi, where he trained a local militia that preceded Blue Mountain. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Blue Mountain used local newspaper ads to assemble a team of 20 guards, many of whom had terror ties, after securing a $9.2 million annual contract.?The guards who were hired were locals who were part of the Ansar al-Sharia and Al Qaeda groups operating in Benghazi,? said the source, whose assignment in Benghazi had ended in November 2011. ?Whoever approved contracts at the State Department hired Blue Mountain Group and then allowed Blue Mountain Group to hire local Libyans who were not vetted.?Many were members of the Libyan government-financed February 17th Martyrs Brigade, an Islamist militia that had previously guarded Americans before being replaced by Blue Mountain.John ?Tig? Tiegen, one of the CIA contractors that responded to the Sept. 11, 2012 attack and co-author of ?13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened in Benghazi,? confirmed to Fox News that the local Libyans who attacked the consulate that night included guards working for Blue Mountain.?Many of the local Libyans who attacked the consulate on the night of Sept. 11, 2012, were the actual? guards that the State Department under Hillary Clinton hired to protect the Consulate in Benghazi,? Tiegen told Fox News. ?The guards were unvetted and were locals with basically no background at all in providing security. Most of them never had held a job in security in the past.?Blue Mountain Libya, at the time of being awarded the contract by our State Department, had no employees so they quickly had to find people to work, regardless of their backgrounds,? he said.But, according to all the reports, the ?guards? did have terrorist ties.The Fox News article goes on to discuss various reports including one from the State Department that says while Blue Mountain fighters did not execute their jobs correctly, they did not participate in the attack itself, a statement contradicted by witnesses on the ground. ?There is also a question as to why Blue Mountain was hired when they were not well known in the security industry and even were rushed into service.According to government records obtained by the Washington-based Judicial Watch, the State Department was in a ?rush? to hire Blue Mountain UK, and its affiliate, Blue Mountain Libya, which together formed The Blue Mountain Group to secure the Benghazi contract.?I understand there was a tremendous rush to get the original contract awarded, and the Service level agreement was most likely overlooked in the rush,? wrote State Department contracting officer Jan Visintainer, in a June 6, 2012, email. Emails obtained from [missing word] after the attack showed Visintainer urged Blue Mountain officials not to talk to the media.Blue Mountain UK was formed in 2008 by David Nigel Thomas, a former Special Air Service official. Charles Tiefer, a commissioner at the Commission on Wartime Contracting, told Reuters the company was not well known.?Blue Mountain was virtually unknown to the circles that studied private security contractors working for the United States, before the events in Benghazi,? Tiefer said.',fake

'The moment we have all been waiting for since Colin Kaepernick took a knee for the National Anthem at an NFL preseason game may well have arrived. ?People at the New American did some digging and found the provision in the advertising contracts that determines how the National Football League must compensate sponsors if the ratings suffer for any reason:The ad rates for a 30-second televised commercial during a game cost from $500,000 to $600,000 for prime-time games. However, if ratings are not up to a certain level, the ad contracts stipulate that the networks must essentially give free commercial time to make up for that decline. This in turn will rile the TV networks that broadcast the games (CBS, FOX, NBC, and ESPN), and may even lead to a renegotiation of the contracts?? thereby bringing in less revenue for the owners to use to pay their players.Oops.One player, Brandon Marshall of the Denver Broncos, has already seen the results of sitting out the National Anthem. ?Two of his sponsors DROPPED him.He lost not only his endorsement contract with Air Academy Federal Credit Union, but another contract with CenturyLink. CenturyLink explained, ?We completely respect Brandon Marshall?s personal decision and right to take an action to support something in which he strongly believes. America is anchored in the right of individuals to express their beliefs. While we acknowledge Brandon?s right, we also believe that whatever issues we face, we also occasionally must stand together to show our allegiance to our common bond as a nation. In our view, the national anthem is one of those moments. For this reason, while we wish Brandon the best this season, we are politely terminating our agreement with him.?Fans this season, for reasons that are still not clear to the NFL high brass even if they are crystal clear to everyone else, have been tuning out resulting in a drop in the ratings game for five straight weeks. ?By double digits. ?As explained above, that means the advertisers lose money. ?Due to that, the NFL must compensate the sponsors with free ad time ? a missed revenue opportunity. ?Will this cost the owners of the franchises enough to change the NFL?s National Anthem policies? ?Only time will tell.',fake
'For weeks now, as the NFL prime time ratings have come in and they?ve been less than stellar, confusion has reigned in the halls of the once vaunted sports league. ?What could POSSIBLY be causing this, executives of both the league and the television networks dependent on the revenue from advertising during the games ask. ?What is making people tune out?Inside the league, and among the sportscasters, the reasons this is so are not exactly reflective of the comments one sees in social media, and on blog posts and news?stories. ?The people wrapped up on the inside of the game blame:And on and on. ?The reasoning centers around the product. ?In some ways, that is refreshing in that the league recognizes that what is on the field has to be entertaining to hold an audience?s interest. ?On the other hand, it ignores the elephant in the room of Colin Kaepernick sitting out the national anthem to protest police brutality and oppression of minorities, two national memes that millions of Americans see as being social engineering by George Soros. ?The ratings began to fall as soon as that protest happened and took hold. ?Fans everywhere commented on public forums that they were done with the league after that. ?And how does the league respond? ?From Bloomberg:In the preseason, Kaepernick began sitting down or taking a knee during the singing of the national anthem to protest police injustice and the oppression of black people in the U.S. The protests have since been adopted, in one form or another, by other players around the league, which has drawn praise from plenty of fans and sportswriters. But within the world of conservative talk radio and websites, Kaepernick now ranks up there in the bugaboo pantheon with George Soros and Benghazi.Which says that the NFL does not know its fan base very well. ?Many Americans who are very much enthusiasts of the game at any level are not part of the ?blame America for every ill? crowd. In fact, just the opposite. ?In backing Kaepernick, the high gurus of the NFL and sports broadcasting put their money on the wrong horse, and killed their golden goose.The powers that be will deny it, but the demise of the NFL?s television ratings are a direct result of not rebuking Kaepernick. ?The double digit drops in television ratings for the prime time broadcasts did not start until that happened despite waning popularity of the sport in recent years. ?Yes, there are numerous issues that the National Football League can and should look at to improve the product both on and off the field, but they need to remember that sports is an escape from reality for fans, not a vehicle to try to shape it. ?And when dependent on customers for revenue, it is never a good idea to insult them or their sense of patriotism even if some people connected to the league brush off concern.Lee Berke, president and chief executive officer of consulting firm LHB Sports, Entertainment & Media, believes the drop in audience is largely illusory and that people are overreacting. ?You?re looking at 20 years of growth, and everybody is talking about four or five games,? he says. ?There are fluctuations in election years and whether you have certain players around. But overall it?s been a substantial increase and retention of audience in the midst of virtually every other category of programming falling off?from sitcoms, to dramas, to movies. The NFL is very resilient.?That remains to be seen. ?In this writer?s hometown, the NFL is dead. ?It may well be dying in many other locales. ?We?ll see what happens with the ratings now that the World Series is over and after the election takes place.',fake
'Nigel Farage, the man who championed the successful Brexit bid of the UK to free themselves of the globalist bonds of the EU, gives his perspective and advice on the mess that Donald Trump now finds himself in heading into the Sunday debate.He says of the debate, ?It?s going to be pretty ugly tomorrow? and laments how ?the big policy stuff, the extent to which big businesses and big banks have been taking us in a direction which is bad for ordinary people? will be bumped down the agenda as the discussion shifts more towards personality.Farage labels the Trump video comments as alpha-male boasting, ?It?s the kind of thing, if we?re being honest, that men do.

He notes that quite a lot of women similarly say things among themselves that they would not want to see on Fox News or on the front page of newspapers.Cavuto asks about the Republicans who are beating a drum to remove Trump from the ticket, saying this is what happens in politics, people look after their own interests. Unfortunately, something he doesn?t point out, is that?s the same thing those in Congress do after they?re elected as well. ?What?s best for the people is rarely the focus.Farage notes that while it?s not good for Trump right now, there are a whole host of stories coming out about both of the crooked Clintons. He says if he were Donald Trump going into the debate, he would apologize for his boorish comments and then make every effort to redirect the conversation back to what matters, ?America?s place in the world, security, people?s incomes, manufacturing industry.?Farage says, ?I think Trump needs to get this, if he possibly can tomorrow, back onto the issues. And when he talks about the issues, there are millions of people out there in America, who haven?t voted for years, who are talking to each other, saying, ?hey, this guy is saying what we?re saying.\'?They agree that there is an honesty about Trump, that you know what you?re getting.

'KANPUR: Demonetisation?s real picture has emerged with the appearance of the One currency note in the denomination of rupees two thousand with a tape in the middle and half printed? with half of the note just a piece of blank white paper. This odd note came out after the customer?s withdrawal of the currency notes from the automatic teller machine. Just as this invalid note was half white paper and half pink paper, the upshot of the demonetisation remained positive and negative in one time-consuming year.Despite the completion of the twelve months of this historic decision, there are prevailing two distinct views. One thinking is that it is a good move for our economy. The hydra-headed monster of the black money has been condensed and use of paperless transaction has increased. However, the critics are not accepting the sudden move as encouraging. They have even equated it with the emergency. One journalist during the course of discussion on the television channel pointed out when he asked the vegetable dealer to accept the payment through the Paytm he denied. When enquired of the payment receipt he further expressed denial, the dealer was bent upon oral dealing.It cleared the fact that there was a scant expansion of the paperless currency. While another participant in the capacity of the Vyapar Sangh office-bearer told that the traders were still not educated enough to pick up the advanced mode of transactions. However, he was suggested by the programme anchor to follow the new changes, he countered how could one grasp high school level learning in absence of lower level schooling. Undeniably, the journalist was correct in supporting the families whose members had died owing to the note ban.

While the punishment sounded fair to the teacher, since it?s been used in India for generations, the problem was their names itself.

'Trump: The orchestration is obvious as is the intent by the establishment politicians to discredit and destroy Mr. Trump. He?s the obstacle to their being able to complete the destruction of this nation so they?ll do whatever it takes to eliminate him.If Obama had put this much effort into fighting ISIS or really stimulating the economy he?d actually be leaving behind a legacy of accomplishment rather than dismal failure and anti-American subterfuge. But Obama views our destruction as his successful legacy and Clinton as being destined for even more ?greatness.?The unconfirmed?allegations are nothing most Americans care about. Certainly Democrats, with their history packed with perpetrating, defending and intimidating in the name of rape and other criminality couldn?t care less if it were one of their own. They are, however, anxious to hypocritically disparage Mr. Trump for things which cannot be proven and are either insignificant compared to what they have done or which may never have even happened.Paul Ryan, as we are learning, likely?played a role, along with NBC and the Washington Post, in?the release of the bus video. The timing of his dismissal of Mr. Trump appears to have been coordinated with an invitation to speak in order to create the opportunity to rescind it and a public act of disavowal. Then the rest of the establishment GOP as well as their sister organization, the Democrat Party, joined in the preplanned feeding frenzy.The next logical and quite predictable step in the Trump vilification process is an attack by the New York Times. That came today, with the sudden ?revelation? of new mystery women who claim to have had unwanted physical encounters with Mr. Trump decades ago. This is the same Clinton advocacy rag that published false stories in May which stated that women had supposedly been demeaned by Mr. Trump.Several of the women, including Rowanne Brewer Lane, who was featured in the first false story, came forward and not only denied the accusations against Mr. Trump, but also noted that the reporters had lied to them, having promised it would not be a hit piece.Once again Hillary Clinton?s ?Birdcage Liner of Record? is attacking Mr. Trump, although this time they?re using much less attractive women, making their claims even less believable. Trump has always been surrounded by beautiful women. Unless they are alleging he was performing charity work, the topic should be a dead, not-starter.We?re supposed to believe that the obvious liberal, who looks like a cross between EPA administrator Gina McCarthy and Burgess Meredith, some kind of larvae-eating environmentalist with hair clips in her armpits, would have been invited to sit in the first class section of the airplane. It?s possible that she was bumped up, even possible that Mr. Trump was actually on the plane. It?s also possible that he was not or that she was moved to a different seat across from him. He could have been the one who rebuffed her advances; perhaps apologizing and informing her that he?s heterosexual, before realizing his error.The woman, Jessica Leeds, claims Mr. Trump was ?like an octopus, all over her,? but states that if he had just confined his groping to her breasts she would not have minded. She said, ?If he had stuck with the upper part of the body I might not have gotten that upset. It?s when he started putting his hand up my skirt.? So she?s fine with being groped as long as the groper stays within the acceptable groping guidelines. Weren?t those commonly kept in the seat back of the chair in front or is that only in coach? And were they kissing during this encounter? It?s unusual for groping to take place without there being some other type of ?getting to know each other? happening at the same time. Did she lead him on and doesn?t want to tell that part of the tale for fear of minimizing its negative impact?Leeds?was so upset that she just got up and left, without ever saying a word and went back to her original seat. She never mentioned the event?for decades, until the time came around for her to tell her story in support of her candidate, Hillary Clinton.Then suddenly new feelings of selective outrage started bubbling up all to the surface so she just had to let them out, and it had to be done with the New York Times. But she?s not to blame for failing to report a crime when it happened. It was due to her leftist conditioning, says Leeds. She said that during her time in business, in the 1970s and early 1980s, ?We accepted it for years. We were taught it was our fault.?What? She was taught that if someone gropes her on an airplane it?s her fault. Is it because she?s been told she?s so irresistible or was it her ear-high mini-skirt that showed all the goods when she sat down, the fashion of the day. It?s odd that the crack New York Times reporters didn?t include anything about what she was wearing in the story, not that it would have made any difference. Trump says it didn?t happen and the New York Times has zero credibility.A second Hillary Clinton supporter has also come forward offering a similar tale from a time long ago in a land far, far away ? in Trump Tower. She claims he was overcome by her charms as well and kissed her on the mouth in a hallway but nobody noticed. The owner of the building and the company is getting frisky in the hall and it?s not seen by anyone? Like Ms. Leeds, that woman also was so outraged that she never reported the incident to the police or her employer.Their dubious accusations both happened to surface at precisely the same, most opportune time, when they would be most advantageous for the Clinton/Ryan/Establishment/Globalist alliance to inflict maximum damage against Mr. Trump. The veracity of the accusations isn?t important, after all. The claims just need to be heard and believed for the pro-Clinton ploy to have been successful.

He notes that, as is presently the case today, ?Whenever people are in power, they have this tendency to try to tilt things in their direction.?He naturally, went on to recommend a federal boot on the necks of the citizenry, a ?federal voting rights division,? to guarantee? that the laws would be enforced uniformly and fairly. It would follow the same conceptual lines as the way DHS has sealed our borders with uniform enforcement of immigration laws or the way the Holder and Lynch at the DOJ or Comey at the FBI have been above reproach in prosecuting all offenders, even former Secretaries of State equally. The kind of system like that in place at the State Department where Muslim ?refugees? are imported almost exclusively over Christians despite being the ones facing the greatest threat.That?s the kind of ?objective fidelity? to the concepts and principles upon which this nation was founded that Obama was in favor of at the time. He spoke in support of a paper trail for voting machines back then, but now, eight years later, his boss George Soros controls one third of America?s voting machines and there is less reliance on paper ballots than when Obama became the first non-American pretend ?president.?Obama said they would be serious about investigating ?vote fraud,? which obviously hasn?t been the case or they?d have Debbie Wasserman Schultz, most of the DNC, Hillary Clinton and the guy making the speech wearing ankle bracelets or behind bars. Violent DNC goon Bob Creamer wouldn?t have made 340 visits to the White House and top Democrats wouldn?t have incited violence against Trump supporters. They are only serious about winning regardless of what it takes, about clinging to power that they will never relinquish, and about keeping their activities hidden from view.Americans need to be vigilant. He?s the same ?big, powerful government is the answer for everything? guy that he warned these people about eight years ago; the one with those tilting tendencies.?',fake
'Those Americans who thought that Hussein Obama had given up drugs might now want to rethink those views, based upon his latest claims. Pretend ?president? Obama claimed there had been no ?major scandal? in his administration during a Democratic fundraiser Sunday night in San Diego. It?s an unbelievable comment the first foreign dictator of the United States made while engaged in a rant against Republican Rep Darrell Issa, the former Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Issa at one time had referred to Obama as ?one of the most corrupt presidents? in modern history, although he?s not really a president, having never met the eligibility requirements. The most corrupt person to ever pretend to be ?president? or to prop his feet up on a desk in the Oval Office would be more correct.Obama said of Issa, ?Here?s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history?despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration?that, when Trump was suggesting that I wasn?t even born here, said, well, I don?t know, was not sure. This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee.? Whatever, Obama, none of that rant made any sense, but as an antidote to your corruption and that of the DC system of illegitimate government, we?re fortunate to have Mr. Trump in that capacity. We just need to make sure he wins.In making his laughable claims, Obama must be counting on the American people and his audience to have the memory of a fly drawn to stench of his oration. The list of Obama scandals is long and varied. It includes his fictional autobiography,? forged birth certificate,? use of a previously issued fraudulent Social Security number, forged draft registration, Chicago Climate Exchange, Fast and Furious gun running, Benghazi terrorist arms running and the deaths of four Americans, the destruction of Libya, complicity with the Muslim Brotherhood, both inside the US federal government and in the overthrow of Mubarek in Egypt.There?s Solyndra, climate hoax, federalization by decree of huge tracts of land, UN sustainable development agenda 2030, gun control, Domestic surveillance, Incompetence, Lies about unemployment numbers and job creation, Obamacare lies, bankrupting of coal, EPA takeover of our economy, UN globalization, servitude to George Soros, anti-American posture at the border, facilitated invasion from Mexico, facilitated invasion from Central America, facilitated invasion from Middle East, importation of unvetted terrorists as ?refugees.?Obama doesn?t mention his curious connection to Frank Marshall Davis being possibly his father, his mother working for Timothy Geithner?s father at the Ford Foundation, being raised a Muslim, promoting Islam, Intentionally weakening the American economy, death of Loretta Fuddy in plane crash, intentional destruction of America?s armed forces, end of don?t ask don?t tell, transgender service personnel, women in combat, giving away of the Internet to his globalist comrades.He created a political weapon of the IRS, Lois Lerner?s Fifth Amendment, Eric Holder?s contempt of Congress, IRS destruction of evidence, Ferguson and elsewhere race war instigating, war on cops, takeover of local law enforcement by feds, Bureau of Land Management as a criminal enterprise, sale of uranium to Russia, TPP, Payment of coyote fees from US Treasury for Central American invaders, classification of most illegals as asylum seekers, sanctuary cities, ending of repatriation of illegals, ambush and murder of LaVoy Finicum, importation of Islamists, interfering in Brexit, interfering in the Israeli elections, removing of Islamic references from federal training and other terrorist documents, VA hospitals, illegal alien amnesty, rule by dictatorship, ignoring and nullifying federal law by memorandum issues by his henchman Jeh Johnson and many others.Whatever he?s smoking, it?s some pretty potent stuff. It must be coming across that open border he has created and Hillary Clinton plans on expanding along with her continuation of the population dilution, part of his racist attack on white Americans. There?s the drug addiction epidemic scandal and the heroin epidemic as well as the murder rate in Chicago and Black Lives Matter racist agitations. There?s also the Hitler-style use of thugs to tilt the upcoming elections in partnership in conjunction with the DNC and Hillary Clinton. The State Dept lack of security, Clinton?s home server, Iran deal, John Kerry and the rest of federal government covering up for Hillary Clinton are also noteworthy.There is no shortage of items in his list of scandals that he?s pretending not to be aware of or hoping we?d forgotten about. The truth has no place in a sentence spoken by Hussein Obama and it is rarely, if ever, found there.',fake
'Back in early August Hussein Obama was asked by one of his adoring trained seals during a press conference about assertions made by Donald Trump that the election was be rigged against him. Obama was asked, ?Can you promise the American people that this election will be conducted in a fair way and are you worried that comments like his could erode the public?s faith in the outcome of the election. And if he does win, given that you?ve just declared him unfit, what will you say to the American people??The great deceiver, who was already vigorously engaged at that time in election fraud, as was exposed by the Project Veritas videos,? replied that he has one vote. That may be true but he has the power to enable many others who ?have one vote? to vote multiple times through his fraud and those who have no right to vote to vote anyway, as many times as they are able to get away with. As illegal aliens, most laws, including those regarding ID fraud, are not enforced against them.Obama then attempts to portray Mr. Trump?s concerns as petty and impossible, saying ?I don?t really know where to start on answering this question.? Most folks would start with the truth, but not Obama. His lips would catch fire.He then puts on his condescending ?cute little smirky boy face? and says, ?Of course the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?? He says the federal government doesn?t run the election process, which is true, although Jeh Johnson and other criminals at DHS are trying hard to insert themselves.Nobody, and that includes Mr. Trump, said it would be the federal government rigging the system. The Democrats, globalists, and establishment GOP have those bases covered. After hiding behind the veil of local governments running the actual election processes, Obama dismissed Trump?s concerns, saying, ?That?s ridiculous, that doesn?t make any sense and I don?t think anybody would take that seriously.?The liar in the White House goes on to say, ?Now we do take seriously, as we always do, our responsibilities to monitor and preserve the integrity of the voting process. If we see signs that a voting machine or system is vulnerable to hacking, (it?s exploited) then we inform the local authorities that are running the elections that they need to be careful.? Why is Jihadi Jeh Johnson asking for permission to monitor the election if they?re already, according to Obama, doing that and informing the locals? Clearly that?s just a smoke screen for the next point, to appear involved on a broad basis and objective.What they do police obsessively, in the favor of the Democrats, is the next point he raises, access. Giving the impression that inspectors are walking around with clipboards conducting random and fair inspections, Obama said, ?If we see jurisdictions that are violating federal laws (excluding immigration) in terms of equal access and uh aren?t providing ramps for disabled voters, or are discriminating in some fashion, or are otherwise violating civil rights laws, then the ?Justice? Department will come in and take care of that.? They?ll invite the New Black Panthers to come in as monitors to make sure no Republicans or crackers do what the Dems are already up to.As usual Obama presents fabrication as fact. Local ordinances across the nation already require public buildings, the kind used for polling, to be wheel chair accessible. That problem doesn?t exist but state and local governments preventing illegal squatters from voting or limiting people to a single vote is something the Democrats take seriously.It was all foundation laying for a point in the future when the attempted theft was is no longer speculation but a reality. That?s why he chided Trump for being proactive in his complaints, to try to silence him through ridicule. Their plan might have worked if their corruption hadn?t been exposed by James O?Keefe and Project Veritas.Obama didn?t need to ask what election rigging means since he has been up to his eyeballs in it since he first propped his feet up on the people?s desk. He was engaged in it against Bernie Sanders in the primary and now with Hillary Clinton?s operatives, including George Soros? Black Lives Matter thugs and their orchestrator, Bob Creamer, through 342 White House meetings. If anyone knows about election stealing, it?s the foreigner who isn?t even an American. He could and probably does, give lessons.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Obama has a history of acting against the interests of the United States and of being more than just a little too considerate?of the demands of the Saudis and other Arab nations in matters of US policy. He?s facilitated the cancerous growth of Saudi-funded mosques inside the United States and the importation of their people into our nation as the seeds of what they see as their ordained future conquest of our country. They are emblematic of their disdain for and dedication to the destruction of our American culture and identity as a?nation. His diversity mission is that destruction of who we are, our reconfiguration into who they are, part of the expansion of their global caliphate.The Russians are coming under fire for standing up to the same adventurism of the Obama Clinton regime that created hell out of a formerly orderly and prosperous Libya. The Obama regime is desperate to serve their Saudi masters in toppling Assad and creating yet another terrorist breeding ground. Obama and Congressional allies, such as John McCain, are waging a war on Assad using terrorists as their soldiers, arming the very people who would have a blade on our throats in the next instant.Russia is exposing a new administration plan to allow an army of raping ISIS?terrorists to flee the city of Mosul in Iraq, complete with their terrorist family units. More than a simple retreat, it is a redeployment of forces, ISIS terrorists under the direction of Hussein Obama. They are to be allowed to escape and then moved to join the fight as Obama mercenaries against Syria. On one section of dirt they are the enemy, a few hundred miles to the West they?re Obama?s boys.As reported in The Sun, an agreement is said to exist that was brokered by the Saudis in which the US and coalition forces will bomb selected, predetermined targets in Mosul and avoid others, with the targeting based upon agreements reached with the ISIS terrorists in advance. It even includes the bombing of vacant buildings in order to provide the illusion of an actual, aggressive military action.The plan was revealed to The Star by a military source in Moscow which stated, ?In preparation for the operation in Mosul, US intelligence agencies and Saudi Arabia agreed that before the assault all militants will be offered a safe route to leave the city with their families.?He continued, ?And at the time of the assault, coalition aircraft would only strike empty buildings, agreed in advance with the militants. More than 9,000 ISIS fighters will be transferred to the eastern regions of Syria to follow a major offensive operation, which involves the capture of Deir ez-Zur and Palmyra.?While it may sound unbelievable that the US would allow safe passage for a terrorist army from Mosul to Syria, it should be remembered that that was exactly what the United States did as ISIS was on the march across Iraq when it first emerged as the ?Islamic State.? Open convoys presented easy targets that could have been destroyed and all of this bloodshed, expense and destruction avoided.Instead Obama protected them then and there is no reason to believe he wouldn?t do the same thing again. The finger pointing goes both directions between Russia and the US but if past actions are any indicator, the Russians may be telling the truth. Especially now that the ISIS terrorists would be headed to Syria to do the bidding of Obama and the Saudis. The Obama thugs have been blaming every setback, every exposure, every military failure or atrocity on the Russians in what appears to be an effort to create a slippery slope into an actual hot war. It?s probably a good idea for them to reveal what Obama?s really up to; who he really works for and with. It?s no wonder he hasn?t been able to defeat ISIS. We now have more irrefutable proof of what we?ve long believed. They work for him.',fake
'Ok, we?ve got some oranges to compare to the road apples the left and GOP globalists have been throwing at our future next president, Mr. Trump. On one hand we?ve got two guys sitting on a bus engaged what they thought was a private conversation with no by standers involved, the Trump ? Bush conversation.On the other hand, you?ve got Hussein Obama doing his best Bill Clinton imitation, getting sexually aroused over something and then exciting himself more by presenting having other people look at him, presenting himself, as they call it in National Geographic videos, for the viewing ?pleasure? of a plane load of reporters.As the video starts out, Obama stands, pretending to be unaware of his erection. That?s not the kind of thing that happens in a vacuum (unless he?s sent in his $19.95 plus shipping) or more correctly, without the knowledge of the individual involved. But Obama?s just getting started. Rather than remaining seated until the situation corrected itself, Reggie?s stud muffin decided to make sure everyone on the plane got a good look.He first stood up in the face of one female, who immediately turned around with a sheepish look on her face and walked to the back of the plane. Obama then posed for a few moments before doing a couple of ?Victoria?s Secret? style spins for his captive audience. Some of the women can be heard telling one of their fellow reporters to sit down as she was blocking their view of the exhibitionist.After a catwalk spin in each direction, Obama raised his leg up, propping it upon a seat across the aisle, allowing for a full and unobstructed view of his package. It?s a display not unlike that we?ve seen from the Mooch when the choice of attire was a little too tight and a little too revealing around the groin area.As it becomes obvious to Obama that he?s making a spectacle of himself, that everybody in the plane knows what he?s doing and looking at him, some decency appears to creep in from somewhere. He?s at least self-conscious enough to move back to a less obvious position from which to generate his perverse Democrat brand of political excitement.As his little show wraps up, Obama looks back at the group for his finale, making eye contact as if he is asking if it was as good for them as it was for him. For most it was probably their first experience with this Obama prick; and unfortunately not their last.Why is it again that the MSM propagandists are so upset about two guys talking in private, out of sight, in their seats on a bus?',fake

'The Un ? ?Affordable Care Act,? Obamacare, was signed into law in March of 2010. Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Hussein Obama forced the piece of bankruptcy-bound legislation, which was designed to fail, upon the American people against our will as a health welfare program.Democrats also loved it because it would destroy our private medical sector while inflicting a huge amount of red ink upon the United States through subsidies and bailouts. It has done just what anyone with half a brain, the Democrat leadership, either never saw coming or never cared was coming. It?s what thinking people in opposition knew was inevitable from the outset.Hussein Obama can?t claim he didn?t know it would end like this, he was intimately involved. He had an MIT economics expert, Jonathan Gruber telling him to just go out and screw the stupid people. Anyone who believes Obama is undeniably stupid, but this is a new group of them, the current millennials. ?We all must know Obamacare is somehow failing in some yet undisclosed manner because of George Bush. Mr. Big Boy Obama will most certainly blame him as soon as someone comes up remotely sellable reason. For now the guy who?s always telling Donald Trump he shouldn?t be whining about Democrat racketeering and election fraud is whining about exactly what he was warned about with Obamacare.His ?Guru? Jonathan Gruber was demonized for being honest enough in an academic setting to admit that Obamacare was a fraud, deliberately structured, ?written in a tortured way to make sure that CBO did not score the mandate as taxes. If CBO scored the mandate as taxes the bill dies.? He also noted that if you wrote it honestly as healthy people pay in sick people get money it wouldn?t have passed. That testimony, on video from November of 2014, shows the intent to deceive and to have the millenials that Obama is speaking to pay for other people?s coverage and expenses. It was the critical component of the doomed legislation from the outset.But to hear Hussein Obama tell it, the fault belongs either with George Bush or with the governors and legislatures of states which are ?hostile? to the act. It?s them, not the exorbitant cost, limited coverage, huge deductibles or limited providers that are not the doctors he told people they could keep that are to blame for its insolvency and impeding collapse. Once again, socialism proves to be a abject failure.It?s all due, Obama tells us, to the states ?not actively participating in outreach.? In other words, the honesty of those people who aren?t repeating the lies in the Ponzi scheme, who are exposing another of Obama?s many frauds, are to blame. Outreach for Obama is synonymous with BS or propaganda. Something at which he?s quite adept.Every excuse he?s using now was known in advance, as Gruber indicated. Particularly in this economy with real unemployment at around 30\%, young people aren?t going to be spending money on health insurance. Any idiot, even a Democrat pretend ?president,? could see this coming a mile away.Here?s Gruber explaining how the lies, fraud and the stupidity of young Americans are critical to Obamacare?s success.',fake

'This morning, an Artist erected an obscene caricature. ?

'?Love stories are eternal,? as they say. They stay in our minds forever. Only the plot changes, characters remain the same. This is evident from the number of movies produced in last century on famous romantic pairs in human history- ?Devdas-Paro? and Romeo and Juliet?.Inspired by the clever approach taken by his b?te noire Anurag Kashyap, who changed the theme of Devdas?s love story from ?love? to ?lust? in Dev.D, India?s CBFC chairman Pahlaj Nihalani has decided to produce a highly-customized version of ?Romeo and Juliet? movie, taking inspiration from the recent events in modern India.Romeo is widely hailed as a romantic-tragic hero throughout the world, but considered a villain in India, thanks to persistent efforts to malign him by forming even a special force (Anti-Romeo Squad) in India?s most populous (and hence most love-making) state Uttar Pradesh.Pahalaj, whose transformation from a filmmaker of vulgar movies that contained double-meaning songs, to a Sanskari censorist puzzled many, has decided the story of Romeo must be retold considering India?s current societal realities.Teekhi Mirchi has?learnt the new movie from Pahlaj Nihalani, to be tiled ?Romeo Must Die?, has distorted the original Shakespeare epic masterpiece to a level, that would make the world rethink the way they look at love and romance.In the movie, The hero?Romeo (Muslim by birth) meets a Hindi girl in Garba festival and falls in love with her. The activists of a right-wing group Hindu Yuva Vahini notice them chatting and point out that Non-Hindus are banned in Garba. The hero Romeo is beaten black and blue by the HYV, and handed over to Police.This prompts a widespread uproar on social media, especially by the liberal brigade, forcing the government to pass an ordinance in Assembly that men can?t talk to women in public, failing which they?ll be held responsible for whatever happens to them next.The government also decides to form a special commando force named after the boy ? ?Anti-Romeo Squad? to give a stern message to general public that anybody who dares to defy the order would meet the same fate of Romeo.The Anti-Romeo Squad puts Romeo in Jail, but the HYV insists on hanging Romeo for daring to trap a Hindu girl, or in other words perpetrating the crime of ?Love Jehad?.',fake

Burhan Wani.?We sent our team of dedicated reporters to the world?s best country (believe us for the sake of first two lines of this report) Pakistan. Our research in Pakistan threw up these startling revelations.Teekhi Mirchi is?the only source of good journalism prevailing in current times (Read the disclaimer). We are the ones who report from the ground zero. (Don?t?compare us with Parkha. *name changed for the sake of nothing).Pakistan?has been described by a great poet with these lines:Off late, with India?s stance on Kashmir getting stricter, there have been similar returns and inflated promises from Pakistan?s ?side as well. When India killed one of the terrorists in Kashmir?s strike, the other day Pakistan declared black-day without being of aware of its consequences. We sent our daring and unpaid reporters (including this one) to Pakistan to know the ground reality of this Black-day.There was a bomb-blast across the road and people around were so habitual to it, that they were not even concerned of the smoke arising out of this bomb blast. It was so black that we decided to inquire with the local authorities if there was a black day that day as well. To our surprise, the authority office was shut down. The lock on the door was catching rust, signifying how many days have gone by without anyone willing to come here. We tried to capture all this on our camera but our batteries were discharged. Thankfully, some of their national heroes had placed a bomb and its remote at the authority warehouse, which guard at the building provided us.He also informed us that it stays like this throughout the year. Power supply would?come for an hour or so. Off late, there have been enormous protests to improve the infrastructure, but then our great and Sharif leader told us that we will be cutting electricity for those one or two hours ?in order to pay respect to Kashmiri leaders, who are dying in their fights with India. So, now we are powerless 24X7.When inquired whether?they were aware of Burhan Wani before the killing, his blank face was enough to tell us that he still was unaware of this name.We asked him further if he has any request for Indian authorities.

'Rep Paul Ryan, the guy who can?t bring himself to support Donald Trump because Trump isn?t conservative enough for Ryan?s taste, had some interesting comments on Friday when he visited the University of Wisconsin in Madison.Trump isn?t a true conservative in the eyes of weasel Ryan, though he?has a strange definition of conservative. As he sees it, Trump is unacceptable because he doesn?t put the interests of big corporate fascists ahead of those of the American people, he doesn?t believe that anyone with a pulse should have the right to invade our nation, and he doesn?t believe the United States should be subservient to a world governing body, effectively giving up our national sovereignty. No, Ryan is right, Trump doesn?t support any of his perverse and distorted, ?conservative principles.?But as it turns out, Ryan may be taking the plunge, coming out of the liberal closet. He may be ready to admit what many of us have known since before he became Speaker, during his times pushing TPP and open borders. The only things conservative about Ryan are the label he puts on himself and the extreme restraint he shows in the amount of enthusiasm he displays for our presidential candidate, Mr. Trump. He?s so conservative in that regard we?d almost think he wants Trump to lose.And that label of ?conservative? may soon be shrugged off as well. When the weasel Ryan spoke to the gathering of UW-Madison?s College Republicans, his scheduled topic was to ?lay out ? exactly what liberal progressivism is and exactly how Hillary Clinton is going to double down on liberal progressivism.?It?s no secret to many that Ryan has much more in common with the establishment street walker Hillary Clinton than he does with the man of the American people, the patriot Donald Trump. He?went beyond merely discussing what he sees as Clinton?s potential actions, he?s identifying with her in some ways, a puzzling course of action for the odd little man who is Speaker of the House, up for reelection in three weeks.First Shepard Smith made it official and then Paul Ryan took that first step in coming out as the closet fascist we know him to be. He declared himself to be a ?classical liberal more than a conservative.? That?s progress, Ryan; while there?s nothing classical about you, the liberal point is undeniable.

'New Delhi: After Yashwant Sinha?s strong criticism about the way current NDA government is handling India?s economy, many ministers have come forward ?proactively? to defend the government.While defending, the ministers use standard responses like how India is the fastest economy in the world. The problem India is facing today are the legacy problems from previous UPA government, three and half years is nothing but little more than 1200 days, not sufficient to reverse all the bad work of UPA. Surprisingly these standard responses didn?t get sufficient empathy for the government. Taking a view of that, some ministers have changed their tactics. Now they have started questioning the ?niyat? of the people who are criticizing the government.One such minister while talking to us he said, ?The reaction is coming from people who are jobless. These are the same people who do not pay a single penny as income tax to the state exchequer for nation building. Taking advantage of the unlimited data plans some telecom providers have provided, these people?s only job is to criticize the government in social media.?We pointed to him that the same jobless people though do not pay income tax, they pay GST for most of the products they buy or the services they use, he told us, ?So, what?s great they are doing. They are only doing their job as the law of the land demands?. On our query does law of the land prohibits such bad ?niyat? people to criticize the government, the Minister got agitated and stood up to leave the interview in the middle.Our reporter who was going to his hometown for Dussehra festival after paying a hefty price for a premium tatkal ticket, got a kick on his ass from railway TTE as he was sleeping after 6 AM. ?Law of the land says you cannot sleep beyond 6 AM.

'According to all major news channels,Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is to make a major announcement at 4 pm today. This has caused a great panic in the country with people starting guess work about what the announcement could be. Any major announcements in the last 2 years have resulted in people panicking and taking measures to lessen the impact on their lives. Be it GST, Demonetization or any new Cess added to the current taxes. The most bizarre story which Faking News got today is a man demanding dowry to be paid in 1 Rupee coins as he fears that Jaitley may demonetize higher denomination notes.The story is of Shwetank Srivastava, who has been always concerned about the financial decisions made by the current government. And like many old fashioned Indians, he is also a strong believer in the practice of dowry. So when his Son?s marriage proposal went as per plan, he took a lot of time in cracking up a good dowry deal with the girl?s parents. And today was the day he was to receive the full amount as agreed upon. But Arun Jaitley?s announcement which is scheduled for 4 PM today created havoc in the mind of Shwetank, who immediately called up the bride?s parents and asked them to pay the required amount in 1 Rupee coins. There is a strong fear in his mind that higher denomination notes may be banned and all money received from dowry can go down the drain.In fact after hearing about Shwetank?s story, many businessmen across the nation were seen approaching beggars, rag pickers, small shops to get their higher denomination notes converted to coins and may be lower denomination notes. Many employees have already taken half day leave as they have to some how get rid of the high denomination notes before 4 PM today.',fake

Just by telling how are spending quality time with your near and dear ones won?t work now days.

'The 2016 election just got even more weird. ?Buried in the middle of the latest Wikileaks dump of John Podesta emails (from his gmail account, too) is this exchange:For some context, the word or words ?wetworks? has a very specific meaning in slang. ?From Wikipedia:Wetwork is a euphemism for murder or assassination, alluding to spilling blood. The expression ?wet work?, as well as the similar ?wet job?, ?wet affair?, or ?wet operation?, are all?calques of the euphemism used by the KGB for such activities, mokroye delo (wet dealings).[1] These operations are reputed to have been handled at the KGB by Spetsbureau 13, colorfully known as the ?Department of wet affairs?For those who are not long time political junkies, Steve Elmendorf, according to Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit, once worked for former congresscritter of the great State of Missouri Dick Gephardt, who was very powerful in Democratic politics when he was voted out of office.What makes this exchange hinky is that it happened on February 9. ?The next death of anyone of consequence in American government was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia at Cibolo Creek Ranch on February 12 or 13 under truly suspicious circumstances. ?To make matters even more hinky, there is a vineyard adjacent to the complex where Scalia?s body was found.This coincidence could mean nothing or it could mean everything. ?From the beginning, Scalia?s death didn?t sit right with a lot of conservatives. ?He was not really sick, and no autopsy was done. ?He was embalmed before any investigation happened. ?He was also one of the few people who was in a position and WILLING to stop the progressive agenda. ?Not only that, with Chelsea Clinton?s words that now that Scalia was gone, they could move on gun control not even three months later, the whole Scalia death episode is smelling more and more like the KGB wetworks definition.This little email exchange just adds to the intrigue. ?Was Scalia assassinated? ?Good question.Before my fellow conservatives go off half cocked about the other major conservative figure death of the year ?

'While wading through the John Podesta emails, this writer found one that indicated David Brock figured Hillary Clinton?s Republican opponent would be Donald Trump back in January. ?Being the busy beavers that the Democrats are when it comes to digging up dirt on their opponents, John Podesta and company already had a 157-page document with loads and loads of information on Trump in addition to reports on Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, those they thought would be a danger to Hillary Clinton?s coronation since December 19, 2015.In that document are references to Donald Trump?s ?mistreatment of women.? ?From Fox News:In a section on Page 31 titled ?Trump Has Devalued And Demeaned Women Repeatedly Throughout His Career,? Trump?s comments to ?This Morning? in 1997 are transcribed under the heading ?Trump On Miss Universe Pageant Winner.??She weighed 118 pounds, or 117 pounds, and she went up to 160 or 170,? Trump said on ?This Morning.? ?So this is somebody that likes to eat.?Machado is not identified by her last name, and her first name is misspelled ?Alisa.? The supposed ?Miss Piggy? and ?Miss Housekeeping? put-downs do not appear either. However, Trump?s printed comments on Machado in the document seemingly show the Clinton campaign began considering using the episode against the business mogul before the primaries even began.So, where Hillary Clinton found the ?Miss Piggy? reference she spoke in September at the Hofstra Debate was not in that document, but the concept was one that the Democratic campaign planned to use from the start.Near the end of the showdown, during a sustained riff about the Republican nominee?s past remarks about women, Clinton cited the case of Miss Universe 1996 Alicia Machado.?And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,? Clinton said. ?He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman ?Miss Piggy.? Then he called her ?Miss Housekeeping,? because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.?As stated above, those monikers are not listed in the 1997 publicity. ?All The Donald said about this woman was that apparently she liked to eat. ?(That gets a lot of us girls in trouble, but we aren?t Miss Universe.)Dirt digging and planning attack strategies is what political campaigns do. ?It?s all about the sales job to get the candidate elected. ?That the campaign had documents and dirt almost a year ago proves that these professionals are good at their jobs?and that they knew they were going to have to go dirty in order to get their candidate elected. ?In the case of Alicia Machado, her story, and the dirt attached to it, did not start to stick until the third debate and Hillary?s mention of it.Other topics of attack were found in the larger document:The Clinton campaign Trump file includes headers such as: ?Reliance On Chinese Goods?; ?Support From White Supremacists?; and ?Trump University.? A subsection in a unit on immigration is titled ?Conspiracy Theories.? Subsections on Trump?s personal life include notes on ?Net Worth,? ?Dodging Personal Bankruptcy? and ?Comments on Fidelity and Pre-Nuptial Agreements.?Give the Hillary people credit. ?They did their homework. ?Too bad most of it didn?t happen the way it was spun and reported by the lapdog media.',fake

'It?s good that the mortal human being, Pope Frank, was only elected as the head of the Catholic Church, and therefore he?s only empowered to ruin the religion of a segment of the Christian population. Frank?s a big believer in unlimited migration, so he?ll surely understand when Catholics migrate to other Christian faiths in response to his movement of their Church towards the satanic influences of liberalism, globalization and his embrace of Islam. ?On Thursday Bergoglio gave a speech to a group of 1,000 Lutherans at the Vatican in which he basically told them that they have no salvation without accepting his and George Soros? invasion. In other words, he told them submit or you?re going to Hell. That?s a pretty heavy problem he?s dumping on the Catholics of the world, one that could so easily be avoided if his danged world conquest weren?t always getting in the way.Frank is a key part of the structure that has created the crisis situation. He?s one of the world government oligarchs who are importing a dependent population into Europe and America and then telling the local populations, ?Here, you deal with it.? Having created a mess that is impossible to resolve, Frank is now running the ultimate guilt trip to get compliance. He has shifted church doctrine to where modeling one?s behavior after the socialists, Marxists, fascists and Muslim agitators Bergoglio, Soros, Merkel, Hollande and Obama is somehow now the path to Jesus.Turning your back on your nation, family, future, sovereignty, quality of life, national identity, culture, and security is the path of enlightenment. That is also the path to an Islamic takeover, so by complying with the hypocrite Bergoglio, one is simultaneously betraying and quickening the subordination of the Catholic Church to Islam. If he?s lucky, the rest of Christianity will follow.Pope Frankie knows a thing or two about hypocrisy, but doesn?t recognize his own. Naturally he preaches hypocritically about hypocrisy. That?s the Marxist in him. ?It was a stretch for him to get there, but he?s the climate hoax, open borders, one world government pope; all of his proclamations stretch the limits of credibility past the breaking point. Bergoglio told his audience that Jesus abhors hypocrisy, and it is hypocritical to call oneself a Christian without welcoming refugees, even those who belong to a different religion.Frank?s laying down some of that white Pope smoke to hide his actions, but his message is still clear; accept the Muslim invasion, give up your space and your nations to them or you will be damned.He said hypocrisy is ?the sin that Jesus condemns most. It is hypocritical to call oneself a Christian and send away a refugee, or one who needs my help. Jesus taught us who the good Christian is in the parable of the good Samaritan.? Hate to disagree with you, Pope, but the good Samaritan tended to a man who had been beaten and robbed, not someone who was coming to invade his nation. In today?s Europe, the very people that Francis is importing are the ones responsible for the highest percentage of crime. So he?s actually on the exact opposite side of the good Samaritan story from where he claims to be. Maybe that was another one of his breaking point stretches or perhaps it?s not in his Koran.Pushing the globalist Islamic worldwide caliphate, just as Hussein Obama does, at every gathering, seizing upon every opportunity, Pope Bergoglio said it was a ?contradiction in those who want to defend Christianity in the West and on the other hand are against other religions and against refugees.? They?re not against the others you thick-headed liberal word-twisting snake, they have chosen their own faith and it is Christianity, not Islam. You have heard of Christianity, haven?t you Pope? Not everybody practices the same religion for a reason. It?s because of their beliefs. You might be disappointed to learn that they?re not all seeking a global religion as you are.He also suggested that he was involved in changing the Catholic Church, noting that the medieval theologians taught that the Church is always in need of reform. ?This is progress,? the Marxist progressive said. He added, ?The greatest reformers of the Church are saints: men and women who follow and practice the word of the Lord and have their soul filled with the gospel.? We can expect some word twisting proclamations based upon some saints in the near future.Always timing his proclamations to coincide with other events for greater effect, Frank matched this speech with a phony UN generated 2017 World Day of Migrants and Refugees. All of you European ?hypocrites? who don?t want to be damned listen up; open up your borders and hand over your countries. The serpent in the white robes commands it.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Pope Frank, the liberal future head of the Global Church of Anything Goes, is working to create his New World Order facade of a church, following a proven path of dilution to the point of irrelevance and extermination. It?s a tactic used in the United States by the current authoritarians in power to destroy our nation and the ?curse of the white boys.?They?ve opened the borders in order to completely dilute our culture, even admitting their sins to a limited degree as their zealous pursuit of multiculturalism and diversity. Both of? those deceptive terms mask the true goal of eliminating white people and white rule. They are stealing the nation from those who built it and handing it over to those who had nothing to do with it and certainly don?t deserve it.It takes a little time but their plan is well on its way to completion. The successful acquisition of points of vulnerability that had to be taken over, Congress and key congressional leadership positions, as well as the media and White House, have eliminated much of what should be overwhelming opposition. Similar moves have been made in the judiciary, all the way up to the Supreme Court.It?s no surprise, in view of the global nature of the takeover, that the Marxist Jesuit Pope, Franco of Argentina, would be elevating his like-minded liberal minions throughout the Catholic Church hierarchy as well. He?s got some serious social engineering to accomplish and those are the kind of people he?s seeking out for his own unholy version of commie ?yes we can? change for the worse.Frank spoke through his actions on Sunday when he promoted ?three new American cardinals seen as belonging to the centrist, non-cultural warrior wing of the country?s hierarchy.? That?s mixed-company, politically correct speak for leftist radicals, the kind that will be active in reconstruction under Pope Frank away from the Catholic Church as it is known. Earth worship, mass relocation of Islamists into Christian nations and the diminishing of current beliefs, such as those against abortion, either are or will increasingly become, the order of the day.The Catholic news site LifeSite was particularly concerned with one of the more prominent appointments, Archbishop Blase Cupich, who shares a Chicago connection with the current White House occupant and other infamous radicals. They described him as potentially ?the most dangerous?-to-the-faith bishop in the United States? noting that he ?has undergone a rapid increase in status and influence in the Church under Pope Francis.?In all Bergoglio the Horrible named 17 new Cardinals, all liberals, passing over senior, more qualified conservatives in the process. Thirteen of them will be able to vote for the next pope, now much more likely to also be a leftist radical.At the same time the communist Pope was poisoning the well of future Church leadership and doctrine, he was reaching out to Islamists for help in his plan to create a global religion, or more correctly, a global denunciation and subjugation of Christianity. For some reason he sees the Catholic Church?s future as being under the sandal of the new universal religion, Islam.Pope Frank announced that he has invited a delegation from the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) to visit him in the Vatican on November 3. The organization?s president, three vice-presidents and secretary general will travel to Rome for a little interfaith chit-chat, according to French media sources. Maybe they?ll find time to squeeze in a Koran reading as well.The secretary general for the Islamists, Adballah Zekri, is quoted as having said, ?I am very happy to meet the Pope because he is a man of dialogue and a man of peace.? Man of dialogue means he?s willing to negotiate things away and peace, to their ear, is synonymous with weakness and submission.The specific motivations behind the action of Bergoglio may be unknown to outsiders, but the general effect is undeniable. He?s working to subordinate the Catholic Church and by extension Christianity as a whole, to Islam at the same time he elevates the earth worship of global warming to equal standing and presses and enables the dispersal of Islamic hordes throughout the civilized world.It?s certainly not very Pope-like behavior but aside from some ceremonial protocols and the uniform, there?s not much Pope-ish about the Jesuit Bergoglio in general. There is much for which Catholics and non-Muslims of every stripe should be concerned.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake

It is the same violence and ?protesting? we are suffering through today, and all because the mob, the proletariat as it were, has been victimized through systematic psyops from the mainstream media in the form of gaslighting resulting in what is essentially Stockholm Syndrome triggered by Pavlovian bells.Yes, that is a lot of authentic psycho-babble, but it is the case. ?The mob has been put up to the criminal, and very unAmerican behavior we see unfolding yet again.And they are blaming people who did nothing other than show up to vote for the person who we all believe will best serve our interests.',fake

'Remember back a ways in the 2016 election campaign when there were people dressed as Donald Duck hanging out at Donald Trump rallies with signs that said, ?DONALD DUCKS?? ?Specifically, they were discussing Trump not releasing his tax returns, but where the actual slogan and tactic came from is rather fascinating. ?Hillary Clinton herself came up with that, and one of her SuperPACs ? in a blatant violation of campaign law ? made it happen.?In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,? says Creamer in one of several exchanges. ?So, by God, we would get ducks on the ground.?It is made clear that high-level DNC operative Creamer realized that this direct coordination between Democracy Partners and the campaign would be damning when he said: ?Don?t repeat that to anybody.?This is a statement included in the latest undercover video from James O?Keefe of Project Veritas. ?This third video outlining the corruption and deceit of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton Campaign for president is below for your viewing.This writer agrees with the reporters. ?The Donald Duck gimmick was silly. ?(Stupid, really, but then Hillary Clinton is a lawyer, not a public relations or advertising creative staffer.)However, what the incident goes to show is just how intertwined the effort to get Hillary Clinton into the White House really is. ?There are lines being crossed that are not supposed to be crossed. ?Period. ?The political action committees are not supposed to be taking orders or ?clearing? their messaging with either of the national party committees. ?That?s not their place in the food chain, and yes, this does smack directly of collusion. ?The trademark and copyright issues would have been a red herring, and a side show, regardless of Disney and ABC wigging out about something that most Americans would roll their eyes to even think about.Rigged, crooked, wrong ? use any modifier in the thesaurus, and it all adds up to the same thing: law and legality means nothing to the Democrats or the Clintons. ?It?s for the little people.',fake
'Every video that James O?Keefe?s Project Veritas releases is a bombshell for someone. ?With his latest offering, ?Major Hillary Donor Inside Dem Fundraiser: Blacks Are ?Seriously F***ed in The Head,?? O?Keefe exposes the overt racism expressed in private by some of Hillary Clinton?s most ardent supporters.The undercover segments feature Benjamin Barber, a donor to Democratic candidate for Senate Deborah Ross,?who also has some racist ? and patently untrue ? things to say. ?Their words are then shown in video form to black pastors who are active in the Civil Rights movement. ?It?s amazing what happens when the truth comes to light.It is stunning to think that politicians and those who are politically connected are so depraved that they will use Americans against their own self interests to gain power and prestige. The entire idea that women and minorities do not have identification is absurd on its face and illogical considering in this country we all must have state issued photo IDs to work, and to receive federal benefits. ?And, after all, that is what civil rights is all about in the end. ?And then to compare blacks doing the dirty work for Democrats to Sonderkommandos, is just an insult.Without getting too deep in the weeds about rage and resentment, it is very obvious from the way these Democrats and Democratic operatives talk about blacks, or African-Americans, that their loyalty is assumed. ?President Johnson?s Great Society is still considered to be the leash that keeps them in the Democratic fold even if they are constantly voting against their self interest. ?That is just nasty.No, this Project Veritas video does not feature any of the current regime in charge or the Hillary Clinton people. ?The people in it, though, are indicative of the atmosphere inside the Democratic Party. ?They pigeonhole Americans into labeled constituencies and assume that they will be loyal thanks to the goodies handed out and lip service to their cultural pathologies. ?If that isn?t racist and sexist, the definition needs to be changed.',fake
'The political establishment and their media propagandists are nakedly pursuing every method of sabotage they can get their hands on to destroy, to take down the last obstacle to their conquest of America from within, Donald Trump. This is the time we have been warned about for as long as we can remember, when our nation would be defeated by forces that exist within our own government. It?s happening and these traitors on display are part of the extensive sales team. ?Just trust them,? they say, they?ll tell us what to think. We can all just go back to sleep secure in the knowledge that our watchdog media is on the job. They?ll wake us if there?s anything we need to know about. Now we?re waking to find our watchdog has chewed the carpet and peed on the couch.Many Americans are falling for the trap. These devils are the ones who provide us with supposed surveys that show the corrupt criminal Hillary Clinton tied with the man of the people, Donald Trump. If they are not honest enough to report on the crimes of this government and to prosecute those who commit the crimes, why would we think they?ll be honest in providing poll results?We see the truth in the crowd sizes and enthusiastic support for Donald Trump. It?s an unwavering support because it is not about him, he simply represents us. In a time when true representative government in this nation and around the globe is becoming a charade rather than a reality, we can?t afford to let this last opportunity be stolen.Just as is the case with Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton, we cannot believe a word that comes out of the mouths of the talking heads on television. They are deceivers by trade, paid liars of the same type as the politicians they pretend to report about. It?s all lies, there are no news reports, only scripts being read to direct us towards a predetermined outcome.How stupid would we be to believe that the massive crowds for Donald Trump that have consistently followed him everywhere he went, all around the country, are somehow an aberration, not representative of his appeal and support? Contrasted with Hillary Clinton?s anemic audiences of paid and bussed in bug-eaters, union members and ?my special interest above all else? voters in the low hundreds and you have a view into the truth that cannot be hidden but which is being ignored.In all of the metrics that can be manipulated they are reporting her as equal to set the stage for the steal. In reality she?s nowhere close which is further evidence of their intention to seize power. The plan is already underway, it will happen. The establishment is protecting their figurehead from prosecution so that she can enrich herself on the way out and handoff power to their former DNC chair, a deeply embedded operative. There is no legitimacy to any of these ?news? organizations. It?s just more of the theater which is going to deliver a Clinton victory no matter what we do as long as we continue to abide by their rules and play within their system.This clip is emblematic of the entire leftist control exercised through a reality simulation. Globalist CFR member and old propagandist now put out to pasture, Bob Schieffer, does his best Bill Clinton ?how dare you? imitation as he feigns outrage at the uppity, unruly peasants.The arrogant piece of elitist trash sits there and indignantly condemns the state of affairs that Clinton and the globalists have brought us to, pinning the responsibility on Donald Trump for daring to stand up and speak the truth.Schieffer says, ?How have we come to this? This is supposed to be a campaign for the most powerful office in the land. Here we?re marching in women, into the hall, who are supposed to be, have some relationship with one of the candidate?s spouses, and what is that supposed to prove??As someone who is either equally stricken with the same dementia as Hillary Clinton or the same selective memory, outrage and corruption, Schieffer forgets that rape is not a relationship and that Hillary Clinton exercised gangland tactics to silence the women. She, not just her rapist husband, was and remains an abuser of these women. To make matters more offensive, Schieffer and the corrupt network he represents then proceed to join in the familiar Democrat pastime of attacking and discrediting those that threaten their power.He continues his little anti-American rant, saying, ?If I?m elected I?m going to put you in jail? I mean this is what they do in banana republics.? Wake up Bobby boy, that is exactly what the criminal regime that is in power and supports Hillary Clinton has turned our nation into. It?s nice you were finally able to notice. He indignantly says, ?This is the United States of America,? as if we?re supposed to ignore the corruption of his candidate due to its magnitude or the size and stature of the victim, our country and ourselves.Schieffer said, ?America can do better than what we?ve seen here tonight,? ignoring the fact that it is exactly that effort to do better, to return our government to the people, out of control of the criminal, lawless elites in the form of wresting control back for the people, that he is hypocritically condemning.Blame yourself you self-righteous old fossil, and the commie bimbos and metrosexuals you share the stage with. We?re coming for our government and our country. It?s ours and we?re taking it back. It really doesn?t matter what you have to say about it.These people, this little coven of ?experts? and not-so-great thinkers who attempt to herd the American people towards their global slaughterhouse have to be dismissed and recognized as the subversives that they are. Americans can?t afford to listen to them. We must listen to our fellow patriots and to our own hearts. We know what is right and true.The big steal is set, the establishment Ryan-Romney Republicans and their Democrat comrades have already combined their forces with the media to manipulate results and the messaging. We must be aware of it and prepared. We can?t allow ourselves to take the bait, or to believe the lies that they are telling.The odds are that no matter the results or how ludicrous the claims, on November 8th the cabal will report Hillary Clinton as the victor in the election. Everything points to that. We need to be prepared, every American needs to be proactive, contact the Trump campaign and offer their services to fight the inevitable. The opposition has been cultivating the Soros BLM thugs?s reputation for violence and employed the Black Panthers for a reason, intimidation. We can?t let them succeed.

'Okay, America, it?s time to knock off this feigned outrage that the word ?pussy? is generating. ?In non-slang nomenclature, a pussy is a cat. ?For all James Bond fans, Pussy is the name of the best Bond girl character ever, Pussy Galore, the pilot in the movie ?Goldfinger.? ?(Readers can draw their own conclusions on the connection there.)In fashion, contrary to the assertions of many a disgruntled commenter, a pussy-bow, or pussycat bow, is a specific high collar with a soft, floppy bow tied at the throat. ?The term was coined in the 1930s, actually, and referred to the sort of bow that was tied around the neck of a kitten. ?From Wikipedia:In 1934, the St. Petersburg Times offered a pattern for an Anne Adams dress featuring a convertible collar which could be worn in four different ways, including as ?an intriguingly feminine pussy cat bow tied high under your chin.?As nothing in fashion is ever truly new, the pussy bow reappeared in the late 1940s, and again in the 1960s with designs from Coco Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. ?However, the most famous of the women in twentieth century history to wear a pussy collar as a regular feature of her wardrobe is instantly recognizable to all conservatives all over the planet. ?Well over half of Lady Margaret Thatcher?s wardrobe sported the catty attire.(Photo by Keystone/Getty Images)?As it happens, the pussy bow was a staple in wardrobes all over America during the 1970s and 1980s. ?This writer, and the other two women in the household generally had at least one in the wardrobe at all times for a number of years. ?Then, in the 1990s, the pussy bow bowed out to make way for other styles.?Then, as all things old in fashion eventually become new again, in 2014, designers sent models down the runway sporting the kitten collars we now know as pussy bows.And THAT, my fellow Americans, is the style that Melania Trump so beautifully presented at the debate Sunday evening. ?The pussy bow is on its way back into everyday fashion. ?(It takes a few years for the runway styles to trickle down to the masses.) ?Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, sported a pussy bow not too long ago. ?Before too long, the rest of us will be wearing the darn things again as well. ?(Doesn?t do jack for those of us with a lot of cleavage.)So, now we know. ?Melania Trump?s pussy bow collar was not made up. ?It was brilliant.More on the history of the pussy bow from Vogue.',fake

'Not that we in the United States didn?t know that our ?leadership? really held us in contempt, but the ?revelations? of Donald Trump?s alleged sexual misconduct and talk honestly demonstrates more of the attitude Lizardhead, uh, James Carville articulated in the quote above. ?They think we are just like them: having a high school fascination for sex, and we?ll follow any red herring dragged in front of us.Not that an interest in sex makes any or all of us less than human, but it almost seems that liberals, Democrats, and feminists have some sort of arrested development when it comes to the topic. ?It?s like they haven?t grown up despite none of them being virgins. ?(The only other people known to this writer that obsessed with sex ARE virgins.) That being the case, the larger coven of ?progressives? seems to think that dragging a $100 bill, or a sex scandal, through the mainstream media is going to distract the public from?well whatever it is they want to distract the people from noticing this week.Over the weekend, the locker room conversation sex tape was meant to neutralize Donald Trump at the debate. ?Didn?t work.Today, Thursday, October 13, a front page New York Times story featuring a woman accusing Trump of groping her a few decades ago on a plane in first class has started to take hold in order to strengthen the meme that Trump is a disgusting misongynist. ?Well, it did until Trump?s people slapped the Times with a cease and desist order, and a threat of a libel lawsuit, and The Gateway Pundit along with commenters from all over the fruited plain started to deconstruct the story. ?It couldn?t have happened the way the story was told, and the accuser used lyrics from a popular song to tell the tall tale.What is going on that the people need to be distracted? ?All of Clinton groupie John Podesta?s gmail account is being systematically aired out by Wikileaks. ?And the revelations aren?t pretty.You can?t make this stuff ?

'Refugees: The United States isn?t the only country that has a two-tiered system of ?justice,? one for the elites, illegals, terrorists, Islamists and George Soros thugs that destroy our cities and assault people in the name of their black racism and another for the law-abiding American citizens. We?re not alone in having a gangster government that exempts themselves for compliance, that allows special interests and protected classes to enjoy immunity from the law while persecuting our native, majority population.Germany, under the fascist EU dictator Angela Merkel, also has a similar and in some ways more compromised mob government that is, as the criminal Democrat regime is doing in America, flooding their nation with terrorists, terror sympathizers, terrorist interns and a few non-terrorist Islamist?s to offer cover for the rest.Merkel doesn?t care what the background is of the invaders she?s importing. As long as they are Muslims she figures everything else is going to work out the way she and her globalist comrades have planned. The invasion is all deliberately imposed upon the people of Europe as is being done to the Americans, in order to change their culture from that of Western Christianity to Middle Eastern Islamo-tyranny.Falsifying a passport is a crime in Germany, just as document fraud is a crime in America, with a penalty of five years in prison. If a white German were to commit that crime in his own native land, he?d be in a heap of trouble. For unknown foreigner invaders pretending to be someone they aren?t, bringing with them unknown risks to the German people, it?s no big deal. The Germans just let them in, ignore the crime and ignore the fact that they have no clue who is now roaming among their citizens. Maybe they won?t blow them up or attack them in a theater, mall, airport or train station.Surprisingly, the German federal migrant agency is admitting to the security failures, acknowledging that they routinely allow invaders to enter even though they are fully aware that the documents they have presented are forged. A recently released report identifies the German agency in charge of ?migration,? the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), as turning a blind eye to forged documents.?A report in Die Welt establishes that of 217,465 passports, birth certificates and driver?s licenses used by those granted asylum, 2,273 were known forgeries. Nobody was arrested and their applications were processed as if they were legitimate.There is a strange kind of self-destruction taking place when a nation invites criminals, which is what those using fake documents are, into their midst. It?s worse when you can?t establish who or what those people really are. Just as with the illegals in the United States using the stolen identification of Americans, nothing has happened. The IRS doesn?t even share the information with the victim and they continue to allow the offending illegal to use the documents, to remain in the United States, and to work under someone else?s name.German law enforcement is quite concerned over the risks associated with the refugees?fraudulent passports, with the Federation of German Detectives (BDK) having called for them to be informed in instances of suspected fraud. As is typical with the pro-invasion government criminals, the BAMF says that?s not their job. BAMF vice-chairman?Michael Bohl said it isn?t ?up to the discretion of BAMF to decide if the law had been broken or not.? It would be fitting if the next terrorist victims are members of their families. Maybe it would become their jobs then.German immigration rules require that any asylum seeker that has either withheld information regarding their nationality or attempted to deceive authorities is to have their claim immediately rejected. You can?t get much more deceptive than falsified passports but no punitive action has yet been taken in any of the cases.It?s not surprising that the same corruption and manipulation of the system is evident both here and in Europe as we are both in the throes of a battle for our survival against the same global government criminals. The tactics are the same, regardless of the location. Passports are one tool of deception, but the deception has many forms and it is everywhere.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) is one of the few good guys in Congress. He?s been vocal in challenging the anti-American predators in Obama?s EPA who want to strangle our citizens in the name of global citizenship. He?s equally willing to take on those within the GOP who share that same lack of integrity, moral foundation, sense of duty to their nation and complete dearth of patriotism. He spoke specifically of the turncoat pantywaist Paul Ryan.Rep Rohrabacher described Ryan as ?cowardly? for his conference call announcement that he would not be helping Donald Trump to win the presidency and would not campaign with him or on his behalf. ?Rohrabacher said, ?Leaders are supposed to stand firm and solid in moments of crisis. Instead, he?s in a panic. It?s not good leadership. ? I think the Republicans who are backing away are gutless.??He added, ?We don?t have to just be concerned about saving House seats. We have to be concerned about saving the United States of America.?Congressman Rohrabacher is giving Ryan too much credit. Ryan is concerned with his power and position alone, as Speaker. He?s not interested in doing with it what will be best for our nation or our citizens, only obeying the commands of those who placed him there. He?s focusing on House seats because without the majority he doesn?t get to play ?Mr. Important Lawmaker? anymore and much of his power and prestige disappears. Power and its rewards?are what truly matter to Ryan.Saving the United States is not a concern of Paul Ryan. He doesn?t see our demise as something negative but as our future as part of the global one world government that he promotes. The gelatin-like spine of Mr. Ryan does not permit him to support a real man like Trump, but it does allow him to still technically, officially not oppose him. He hasn?t withdrawn his tepid, limp-wristed endorsement just yet. That?s the one traitorous card he is still holding in his hand, yet to be played, raised and poised at the ready.Rohrabacher wants no part of their betrayal. He?s solidly behind Mr. Trump and the United States of America. Regardless of the outcome of the election, we may see a different Speaker for the next session. Ryan should never have been there in the first place and were it not for the surrender of the naive Freedom Caucus, would not have been.The Congressional GOP jellyfish could learn a lot about being a representative from Rep Rohrabacher.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'The mainline Democrats shrug off Donald Trump?s assessment that the American political system is rigged, but there are many people in the country who agree with him. ?One of those people is documentary producer Jeff Hays. ?Hays and his team of filmmakers followed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson around on the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, and were able to put together a documentary that is sure to confirm Mr. Trump?s astute opinion of the American political system.Their goal with?Rigged 2016?is to expose the masses to Johnson and help him to get his poll numbers high enough to be invited to the presidential debates, which right now include only Democratic nominee Clinton and Republican nominee Trump.?The big lie is we only have two choices,? says Byrne. ?Let the people compare him to the other two. He?ll mop the floor with them.?Byrne refers to Patrick Byrne of Overstock.com who financed the project with $400 million. ?For anyone who has paid attention this year to Gary Johnson and the other third party candidates this political season, the hope of launching Johnson to the White House is a bit of a pipe dream. ?No, the choices from the main political parties are not ideal by any means, but neither Johnson or Jill Stein of the Green Party are cut out for the job.However, the main point of the documentary is well taken. ?The system as we know it in the United States is rigged. ?It is rigged toward established corporate interests who have no interest in anything more than their bottom lines. ?The people calling the shots certainly do not have the welfare of the American people, or our mental health, on their list of priorities.And that, ultimately, is the point.',fake

'Delhi/NCR: Bikers in this part of the country always come up with the unique ways to surpass cars/trucks/buses and get ahead on the road in this unofficial race that keeps on happening on Indian Roads. Sometimes, when roads do not have enough space, footpaths come to their rescue. Some great man once under the influence of weed said-?Necessity is the mother of invention.?It became a famous quote henceforth. People in the automobile sector were seriously thinking about the troubles faced by these bikers on roads to stay ahead, and hence have come up with the unique plan to introduce rubber bikes with slim tyres.On being asked about the advances of this sort of bikes, the reply came:?You can bend the handles.

'Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the leader of Russia?s third largest political party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. He?s a fierce combination nationalist and?populist with a style that is described as?brash and confrontational. Though generally regarded as being anti-Western, this member of the Russia State Duma, the lower house of Parliament does have an opinion on the American election. He might be a hardliner but he?s not suicidal. He, like most of the rest of the world, has had enough of Hussein Obama and is opposed to four more years of the world spinning around the globalist drain.In an interview from his large, tenth floor office, Zhirinovsky told Reuters that those Americans who want peace must vote for Donald Trump. It is his opinion?that Trump is the only person able to deescalate dangerous tensions between Moscow and Washington.He said, ?Americans, when they vote for president on November eighth, must realize that they are voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for Trump. But if they vote for Hillary, it?s war.?He continued, ?Trump will have a brilliant chance to make relations more peaceful. To start talks, to take positive decisions on Syria and Ukraine, on NATO, on disarming and plutonium. He is the only one that can do this.?As for the hand-wringing in the media over Trump?s comments, Zhirinovsky takes a realistic approach, saying, ?Men all around the world sometimes say such things that are just for their comrades. They?re just saying, but that doesn?t mean that it is an attitude towards women, children, black people and Muslims.He adds, ?Victory for Trump and his election as president would be a gift to humanity. This is no joke.? ?While it wasn?t exactly an endorsement from Putin himself, the point is made that Zhirinovsky is allied with and faithful to Kremlin policy. The impression is given that he would not be making such statements without the approval, at least tacitly, of Vladimir Putin.Putin knows what happened in the Middle East and Libya. He knows what kind of criminal and traitor Hillary Clinton is. With a nationalist loyal to his own nation, Putin would have a dependable and consistent adversary or perhaps an ally in some areas. In the case of Hillary Clinton, he?d be dealing with a globalist servant that would inevitably seek to destabilize his own nation or regions of the globe Russia has an interest in.It seems obvious that it is in Russia?s interest to see Mr. Trump elected; that Mr. Zhirinovsky?s words have the ring of truth to them.',fake
'The weasel is out of the bag and its name is Paul Ryan. Jack Posobiec, the Special Projects Director for Citizens For Trump, tells a tale of deception and betrayal of the most despicable kind, and? it revolves around a power play made by the vile filth, the rodent Rep Paul Ryan, a subhuman mongrel that has shamed the entire state of Wisconsin.As it turns out, the video of Trump and Billy Bush that was leaked from unknown sources has been traced back to Ryan. The anti-Trump operatives never bothered to investigate the source, those on the networks, the GOP establishment and the Clinton campaign were just happy it had appeared and were delighting in the feeding frenzy intent on driving him out of the race.Ryan?s little event in Wisconsin was to be the stage for him to feign his indignation and then dismiss Mr. Trump in unison with their fellow operatives such as Senator Mike Lee of Utah. When critical mass was reached they would use an unwitting and uninvolved Governor Mike Pence as the vehicle into which to attach themselves in Trump?s place.Trump would be forced out, Pence would move to the top of the ticket and Paul Ryan would slide in. Clinton would still likely win, which is completely acceptable and the lesser of the two evils for the establishment whores in the GOP. They would then focus their efforts on picking up the globalist pieces with a Ryan/Rubio ticket for 2020.Once again, according to Posobiec, those who targeted Mr. Trump underestimated him. They thought they could force him to quit, which he does not do.

'Sachin Tendulkar?s much talked about Smartron smartphone which was launched today amidst rave reviews also got some flak after reports of ?battery issue? surfaced in the media.Many first time users reported that the smartphone fails to charge beyond 99\% even after extended hours of charging, which made them wonder if this was intended or some glitch in the product.Speaking to Faking News, one such user said, ?I am a fan of Sachin and was waiting for this product to be launched. But the moment I started charging it, the battery displayed full charge at 99\%. Initially it looked like a bug. But when others too reported the same issue. I thought it was some smartphone feature specific to this product,? said Rohan Salgaokar, an MBA student.Loyal fans of the master blaster were angry, some even thought that the company trolling Sachin and refused to buy the phone till the problem was rectified. ?I can understand that the smartphone needs to have features that remind us of Sachin. But this 99\% charge is not in good taste. If this is not rectified we will boycott the product,? said an angry Sanjay Mhatre, President of Sachin Tendulkar Fans Union (STFU).STFU has also asked its yuva members to stop attending schools, colleges and offices till their demands are met. ?Just like how Sachin bhau bunks Rajya Sabha, we will also bunk college and office,? said one member.To prevent this matter from snowballing into a major controversy, makers of the smartphone have assured that the matter will be looked into.

'For the first time in over 50 years, the police department in Palm Springs, California, is mourning the loss of officers killed in the line of duty. ?Three officers were shot answering a domestic disturbance call on Saturday, two of them dying due to their wounds.The deceased are 35-year veteran Jose Gilbert ?Gil? Vega who was due to retire in less than a year, and?Lesley Zerebny who was with the force only a year and half and gave birth to a daughter only four months earlier. ?The third officer is alert and responsive.(Via USA Today) ?Today Palm Springs lost two brave officers,? Palm Springs Police Chief Bryan Reyes said at a news conference, his voice shaking with emotion. ?I am awake in a nightmare right now.?Shortly after noon, dozens of police descended on a Palm Springs residence in response to a call for help from the scene. ?According to reports, the suspect in the case simply opened fire.?It was a simple family disturbance and he elected to open fire,? Reyes said?.Witnesses said they heard between 10 and 20 gunshots from what sounded like machine guns. Over a dozen patrol cars, three fire engines and a SWAT truck were at the scene of the incident at 2 p.m.Officers searched the surrounding area while residents of Palm Springs laid flowers in a make-shift memorial at the police station. ?Fellow officers did try to revive Zerebny to no avail.One person at the scene indicated that the story is not nearly as cut and dried as the suspect just opening fire.Frances Serrano, who lives directly across the street from where the shooting took place, spoke to the father of the suspected shooter moments before the incident. The father told Serrano that his son, who has mental issues, had a gun and wanted to shoot police officers.?He came over and asked for help,? she said.',fake
'Salman Khan recently shared the first look of Race 3, which is the third installation of the Race series.The actor has begun shooting for the film, which is directed by part-time director and full-time reality show judge Remo D?Souza. Salman, who is all excited for the high-on-action film, revealed that he?s put his blood and sweat in it as he has been preparing for this role since 2002. The first two films of the Race series were about fast cars and mind-boggling suspense in the form of twists and turns. Talking about how his life has been a near-similar race, Salman said, ?The film is about fast driving; even if you are under the influence of alcohol, you must know how to be safe. In the first two films, you saw how fast the cars were driven on the road. In Race 3, we?ll be conquering footpaths as well.?The actor, in a press conference, revealed that he?s been ?preparing for this role since 2002? September 2002, to be particular? 28th September, 2002, to be precise?, and that it is ?not quite a movie that challenged his acting skills?. Remo D?Souza, who took a leave from judging the reality show on the day, was present at the press conference. ?Race 3 is a thriller that will up your adrenaline levels. The suspense in the film will spin your head to the extent where you will never know who the real villain is, even after 15 years from the release of the film,? he said while giving a high-5 to Salman. Salman faces immense pressure to deliver a hit after his last film, Tubelight, did not light up the box office. ?If Race 3 does well, I will earn 300 crores. In case the film fails at the box office, my driver will publicly accept that the actor in the film was him, not I. Moreover, I will also donate some amount in charity so my fans can excuse a bad film,? Salman joked. To assure the distributors and stakeholders of the film, Salman went a step ahead and explained, ?If good films like Newton and Hindi Medium can earn 10-20 crores, I?m sure that the Indian audiences will help Race 3 cross the 300-crore mark. I have full faith in judici? err, in my fans,? he said, before concluding the press conference.',fake
'Maybe you have to be dumb enough to be a liberal not to see through this stunt or to at least be dishonest enough to pretend that you?re too stupid to see it for what it is.The original lie in which the supposedly honest Pope Frank played a role was the ?spontaneous? recognition of the little girl,? Sophia Cruz, as she ran into the street as his motorcade approached. Sure, security is that loose and don?t bother with any child endangerment investigation, they?re running a scam on America that is both Pope and Obama approved.In that instance she delivered a scripted note to Pope Frank, before Trump ever announced for president. This time around, the child of illegals squatting in our nation is once again being given an orchestrated national platform. She?s the next Khizr Khan or Alicia Machado, the Democrat personalization of ?how heartless and cruel? Donald Trump is.It?s being reported that Cruz may be fed another question to put her name at the bottom of and take her position as the Donald Trump victim of the week, with another scripted message being plagiarized as her own. This time the note being written for her will be read aloud and is reported to contain the following:??If you deport my parents, what happens to me? I am 6 years old and an American citizen. I have a 3 year old sister who is also an American. My heart is very sad, because I?m scared that ICE is going to deport my undocumented mommy and daddy.? The note, intended to sound like a six-year-old wrote it and not a Clinton staffer, is posted on the Open Debate Coalition website.It?s obvious that a six-year-old didn?t write it. The structure, while simple, is still much above the level of a first grader. She knew to use the pronoun ?an? instead of ?a,? pretty good for a kid that lives in a Spanish-speaking household. She also knew that ?Immigre? is really called ICE is all capitalized although she did erroneously use the word undocumented to describe her illegal alien squatting foreigner parents.The question, intended to damage Trump and pave the way for a range of insults to be unloaded upon him over the course of the next week or so, is posted as hers at the website presidentialopenquestions.com, where the ?thirty top questions? will be ?considered? by the biased ABC and CNN moderators for the debates. Does anybody smell a setup?The correct answer to the question is that the little girl packs her bags and goes with her parents while they petition to return legally. She could also stay with other family members if she has any, in America who are legally here. Going back to Mexico or whatever country her parents belong in is the same situation she?d have been in had they not broken our laws. Now she has the benefit of American citizenship for later in life.That was easy; next question.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'POK: Terrorists are always looking for new options to attack people with. They try to get weapons which are not easily detectable by police and other investigating agencies.Pakistani terrorists who have been brainwashed to attack India regularly have found a new weapon, in case they are short off conventional options. They have been supplied with latest weapons from ISI and the Pakistani army, but now they have figured out a cheaper alternative which will help them during their attacks.Samsung galaxy note 7 has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. 1800 phones have caught fire and Samsung has blamed faulty battery for this massive issue. Samsung has recalled all the faulty phones, but now the terrorists want them at a premium price so that they can use them as a weapon.The phones will come at a cheaper price as compared to guns, grenades and other weapons. Terrorists are trying to figure out a way to clear all phones from the market and supply it to their colleagues who can then use them as weapons.Well, it?s a dangerous situation for Samsung as they would not want their products to be used by terrorists.

'Brussels: There is a bad news for the entire scientific community searching for extra terrestrial life outside of earth. A group of researchers based in Brussels have claimed that life is only possible on planet earth, adding that, we homo sapiens are indeed special.Humans have been desperately searching for clues of life in our solar system and other galaxies, even those that are millions of light years away from us, hoping that we someday receive a radio signal from them, and send a ?acklowledgement? signal back that reaches them millions of years from now. Humans are definitely not likely to survive by that time, and hence this exercise is widely believed as an attempt to frustrate aliens.This discovery by researchers has come as a big blow to the SETI project, that searches for alien life throughout the universe. Humans are wondering whether the money spent on this fruitless exercise could be put to better use such as saving life back here, and its possibility in future.When asked, a member of the research team revealed that they came to this conclusion based on the fact that all the Miss Universe contest winners so far have been from our world alone.?It would be very arrogant to think that we?re the only beautiful species throughout the universe, of a size it?s impossible for human brain to imagine. So, if alien life really existed, they would definitely have participated in this contest of prestige, and won several awards, but that?s not the case,? explained the member.?We modeled the universe in 4D, based on this important fact through supercomputer simulation and found no traces of life in our model right since big bang to end of the universe. Hence proved- we?re at the center of this universe, as believed?in ancient universe models, and that, we?re the one!? said the lead researcher.',fake
'There are many questions that the sheeple of America need to ask themselves before they vote for their globalist slave master and tool of Saudi Arabia, Hillary Clinton.

The video notes it is possible she could soon become Chief of Staff at the White House, if the coup that is currently underway is successful.\r\nThe narrator starts by identifying four primary players in the events surrounding the Clinton-Saudi situation, Hillary Clinton, Huma Abedin, Abdullah Omar Nasseef and Saudi Arabia.

'Former India opener Virender Sehwag?s childhood coach Amar Nath Sharma slammed BCCI?s decision to conduct interviews for coaches via Skype. Only Sehwag was present physically at the Wankhede Stadium?s Cricket Centre in Mumbai for the interview. But maybe the final outcome was not based on performance only. There are rumors doing rounds that Sehwag under performed in the interview to keep Shastri away from the commentary box.Most of the media houses reported that Sehwag was a strong contender for the post citing the not so warm Sourav-Ravi equation. Even Indian fans wanted Sehwag to bring that aggressive intent in the dressing room. But sources say Sehway was in a big dilemma. After taking up commentary, Sehwag had a dream of becoming the most followed commentator in the world and for it to happen, he had to plan the ouster ?of Ravi Shastri from the commentary box. He gave in to such dreams and tanked the interviews, something b-school students?when forcefully interviewed for companies they don?t want to join.But Sehwag has denied such rumors and said,? The rumors are baseless. Why would I under perform to keep Shastri out of commentary box. Shastri?s commentary has reached such levels of boredom that in the coming months, broadcasters themselves will throw him out like a? tracer bullet.? When I gave the interview?all three results were possible,?1. I lose 2. I win 3. I under perform. But I chose to lose rather than under perform. Sehwag has never under performed and Sehwag will never under perform. My wishes to Ravi and am sure he will take team India to new heights, I mean to clubs which are located on mountains.?Our Faking News team will try and bring out the truth in the matter, but till than lets hope Kohli and boys have some great time under coach Ravi.',fake
'Television movie channel Set Max announced a Diwali bonanza for its viewers after various channels threw their schemes to attract maximum number of viewers. The channel, which holds the official broadcasting rights of Sooryavansham, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan in grey beard, has decided to air the film four times on the day of the festival.After getting several requests from viewers to stop airing the same movie every night, the producers at the channel have become even more adamant. Explaining us the reason behind trying to make Sooryavansham everyone?s most hated movie, a channel executive said, ?Like the teenager who has many clothes in his wardrobe but still wears the same pair, we have a great collection of movies in our library but will still air Sooryavansham every night, and we will continue to do so.? A Delhi-based viewer has also filed a complaint in the consumer court against the movie channels. ?In my complaint, I have specified that all these channels air dubbed movies from the South all day, which is as attempt to influence our culture. We do not even know the difference between Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam movies, so why show it to us all day?? said the aggrieved viewer.Actor Amitabh Bachchan, who plays a double role in Sooryavansham, has distanced himself from the makers of the film. He further intends to buy the broadcasting rights of the film from Set Max. ?They show it every night! On Diwali, they have planned to make it more miserable for me.

'Three of Bill and Hillary Clinton?s many victims sat down for an interview with Aaron Klein at the Watergate Hotel in Washington DC, to give the world a wake-up call about the sexual predators that are attempting to manipulate their way back into the White House.Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick know firsthand the criminality of the Clintons, having experienced rape and sexual assault by the former president. They have also been victims of the personal attacks against their character, threats and intimidation inflicted upon them by his enabler and cover person, his wife Hillary Clinton.They want everyone to know that Hillary Clinton is not an advocate for women, as Willey describes her, ?she is a fake feminist.? They say Hillary Clinton took an adversarial approach from the beginning towards them, having never once attempted to talk to any of them. They note that had Clinton reached out and talked to them she would have found out that they were telling the truth, the true nature of what her husband had done to them. But she never did, ?because she didn?t care to.?Asked if they believe Hillary is an enabler, Broaddrick responds, ?Oh my goodness, there?s not a better word, for any of this, especially when she threatened me personally.? Willey adds, ?She?s implicit in everything he?s done.? Paula Jones adds, ?She?s helped him do it.?Klein asks how they respond to those who dismiss their claims as ?Bill?s infidelities.? Jones replies, ?We didn?t agree to do this stuff, he pushed himself on us.? Broaddrick says, ?This is criminal. We were not willing to the acts that he performed. We were not willing participants. These were crimes.?Kathleen Willey says, ?Rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, I want to say this to the mainstream media, Andrea Mitchell, Jake Tapper, all of these people. These are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail. They would be in jail for a very long time. This is no longer about infidelity, indiscretions, girlfriends, sex, interns, none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a predator, and his wife, who has enabled his behavior all of these years.?Paula Jones adds, ?And he exposed himself to me, that?s a crime. You?re not supposed to expose yourself to people.?They point out that Hillary has turned a blind eye to the actions of her husband over all of these years and she has been the one to help cover it up and go after them.The thought of? Hillary Clinton having the military, NSA, CIA, multiple intelligence agencies at her disposal as president, the most powerful person in the world, a frightening prospect for the ladies. They say it should terrify all people.Willey warns, ?She will annihilate any enemy, all of her enemies, anybody who?s spoken against her, across the board for I don?t know how many years, she will get rid of them. She will spend her entire administration ruining people. That?s what she will do, instead of running the country.?Broaddrick says, ?It?s frightening.? Ms. Jones asks, ?How can Americans not be frightened about this? How? do they think we?re sitting here, all three of us, and we?re making this stuff up? How can they not be in fear for this woman to run our country and to sit up there and pretend she cares about anybody, much less a female?

'Sheriff David Clarke did something that not many are willing to do, particularly the treacherous snakes that have hijacked our nation. They won?t identify the enemy, at least not publicly, and never when it comes to their terrorists allies that should be named. Their true enemy is the American patriot, an identification they undoubtedly make multiple times a day in more private settings.Clarke?s not a coward, he is a man of principle who understands the threats facing this nation.

Clarke wrote, ?It?s incredible that our institutions of government, White House, Congress, DOJ and big media are corrupt and all we do is bitch.

He?s asked, ?You said pitchforks and torches time, what do you mean by that??Clarke says, ?I meant the same thing Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist said when he said that the institution of slavery is a system of brute force and it must be fought with its own weapons. I meant the same thing when Barack Obama in 2008, July of 2008 at a fundraiser and talking about how he would deal with Republicans he said, ?If they pull a knife we?ll pull a gun.\'?As Steve Doocy nods in what may be subconscious agreement, Clarke continues, saying, ?I said the same thing when during the entire summer we had to listen to Bernie Sanders talk about the need for a revolution in America and the leftist media, Fox not included, Fox News, the leftist media had no problem with that.?.@SheriffClarke: It?s time for ?pitchforks & torches? in America pic.twitter.com/xpaTWRZGfd?

'SHOCKING EVIDENCE: It seems that we may now have an explanation for the nonsensical, bizarre and hostile behavior by both Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan during this campaign season. They seemed to picture themselves as the white knight couple who would ride in to the rescue when all of this rancor and other chaos they were plotting in league with their establishment globalist cohorts unfolded.The problem it seems was once again Donald Trump. He was able to secure the nomination and no matter how hard the subversive tools of the world government tried there was no getting around his grip on the nomination. And they tried very, very hard. They?re still at it as the misconduct of Ryan over this past weekend in the eleventh hour of the election, a time when all disagreements should have been put aside, exploded.Clearly now, the explosion was deliberately set off by the establishment sponsors of the Romney Ryan ticket in the form of an unsuccessful smear attempt through the release of an old video. The feigned outrage of Mitt Romney?s ally in the subterfuge, Utah Senator Mike Lee, as well as that of the vile excrement that occupies the position of Speaker of the House is now clearly coming into focus.They don?t want what?s best for America, a conclusion we reached long ago, based upon their actions, they want what is best for the Chamber of Commerce, for the passage of TPP, for their world government organization and power structure. The fact that all of those interests are at odds with what is best for America never entered into the picture.The scope of this conspiracy will be an interesting revelation as well. We remember the Romney Summit in June in Park City, UT, in which the nevertrump scum was meeting to discuss their way forward. Clearly they had already decided on a path, they just couldn?t let it be known.That is how things work in today?s modern world of criminal, deceptive governments and politicians. The people are always the last to know, by design.

'Yes, it?s official. ?The 2016 election season is bringing all sorts of stuff out of the closet and storage thanks to Donald Trump. ?Not only has he talked about how crooked Hillary Clinton is, he?s also talked about American elections being rigged. ?This charge, of course, is bringing the old guard to the surface to deny the claims all while James O?Keefe?s Project Veritas, and Julian Assange?s Wikileaks are putting out leaks and undercover videos proving that Trump is right.That isn?t stopping Ohio Governor John Kasich from speaking out on the topic, though. ?This is the same John Kasich whose Political Action Committee took over $200,000 from a Soros foundation. Via CBS News:?Look, to say that elections are rigged and all these votes are stolen ? that?s like saying we never landed on the moon, frankly,? said Kasich. ?That?s how silly it is.?The Ohio governor further criticized Trump?s position for sowing paranoia about the integrity of democratic institutions.?I don?t think it?s good for our country, for our democracy, and I don?t believe we have any massive fraud,? Kasich said. ?We don?t have that. That?s just a silly argument.??The problem is it does create doubt in people?s minds and I worry about 25 percent of Americans who may say when the election?s over that it was stolen,? he added. ?That is a big, fat joke.?For the millionth time, we in the United States have a representative republic, NOT A DEMOCRACY. ?And how Kasich, who is governor of one of the states that is regularly targeted as a ?swing? state thus making voter fraud and rigging low hanging fruit for the scheming opportunists of the Democratic machine, can go on national television and deny that it?s happening when proof is popping up like weeds?..Stunning.',fake

The governor will find out just how out of touch he is with his own constituents after the polls close tomorrow evening.All of his lofty talk about being dedicated to the protect ?the least of us? is an outright lie. In Ohio, the people who fit in that exact category have not seen Kasich since an extremely brief campaign stop when he first ran for office.I live in the poorest region of Ohio. We have not experienced ANY of the job growth he constantly brags about during debates. We have trained and educated workers, near zero crime, good roads, and broadband Internet.What we don?t have are jobs, a grocery store, a hospital, or a single place where mothers can buy baby food or formula for their babies.Our county commissioners would bend over backwards to have a chance at some of the jobs created by companies Kasich enticed to Ohio. We can?t even score temporary jobs for skilled workers when state road work and other projects reach into our rural area. Because of all the big government red tape and union rules, those high-paying jobs go to crews from the city who constantly get lost when they come to the job sites. Kasich promised to change that during his first campaign ? he never even tried.Donald Trump was right when calling Kasich an absentee governor. If he had enough time to leave Columbus to be on the campaign trail for months, he definitely had the time, over the past eight years, to visit each of the 88 counties in our fine state at least once. He did n0t.Thus putting John Kasich in the category of the globalist oligarchy water boy. ?Thank Heaven he flamed out at the presidential level.',fake
'Some years ago now, on a Monday morning, a huge merger between two titans of entertainment was announced out of the blue. ?Disney and ABC were joining forces. ?This came as a gigantic shock to absolutely everyone in business and entertainment. ?Why? ?Because no one had caught one whiff of what was happening in the rumor mill or grapevine. ?The people who negotiated the merger had kept it quiet, basically by not using the airwaves, or cell phones. (Email wasn?t as big a thing then, but it was avoided, too.) ?Negotiations were done over coffee and the details spelled out on napkins, not Word documents, until it was all over.That particular business deal should be one of the great lessons learned in modern communication: if you want to keep something secret, talk in person or on landlines, put information on paper, and never, ever, mention the topic on a mobile phone or in email. ?It?s too easily intercepted. ?(This is why no one should ever put their Social Security Number or Credit Card Information into a form on the internet without being on a secure server.)One would think the ?smart people? of government would get that. ?Apparently not.For the last week, we of the online armies have been wading through an email cache that all went through a single email address, [email?protected], and was obtained by Wikileaks. (When dealing with bombshell information, it?s always best not to ask too many questions about how it was acquired.) ?John Podesta, currently, is Hillary Clinton?s campaign manager. ?For decades, though, he?s been known as the political ?fixer? of the Clinton machine.Podesta is not at all a dumb man. ?Not even. ?He?s ruthless, and takes no prisoners, but in no way is he without wits. ?Which makes a handful of observations about the messaging confounding.First off, many of us out here have used the gmail hub option to manage multiple email accounts. ?This writer at one time had four accounts all hooked into a main gmail address. ?It?s amazingly convenient, and does assure that one is constantly connected to smart devices. ?For information shared and needed for CYA purposes, having the date and time stamp on an email or message is invaluable. ?However, for communications on sensitive stuff ? say terminating an employee ? that was usually kept off that avenue. ?Paper was passed around, and discussion via landline was preferred.There is also a certain advantage in real time communications. ?This is why email was invented after all ? for the battlefield. ?However, when sensitive information can be tracked, and hacked, it?s time to rethink using that specific method.And then there?s the matter of gmail, a product of Google, itself. ?After the Edward Snowden revelations, and knowing just how much information the government can vacuum up thanks to back doors and meta data spying programs, many of us quit using the medium ? and all other social media ? for controversial or blackmail eligible information. ?Podesta, it seems, didn?t. ?Google is just as hackable as any of the other big named systems. ?Using a gmail account as a hub is almost an open invitation.In going through the emails available so far, Podesta talks about hooking into Amtrak?s public wifi which seemed to mess up his system. ?If he?s hooking into an unsecured network like Amtrak?s, why would he not hook into others?Stolen or not, the judgement ? or lack of it ? displayed in having all this sensitive information on an email account that does not go through a secure and dedicated server is questionable at best. ?Did Mr. Podesta think he would not be a target simply because he doesn?t work directly for government? ?Just being part of the Clinton machine puts scrutiny on a person, justified or not. ?Maintaining channels of communication with an eye on possibly being intercepted should be top of mind. ?No one is interested in the fundraising emails, or the test communications that are already approved?it?s approval process that?s of interest. ?How the people are being manipulated with language and emotion laden words that all of us who took public relations know how to inject in our messaging. ?That is the sort of thing that is most revealing. ?Other than the possibility of a Supreme Court Justice being assassinated, of course.To answer the CNN reporter who said that the Podesta emails were stolen, and it is illegal to be in possession of them?the genie is out of the bottle. ?There?s no putting it back. ?Illegal or not, We the People are getting a glimpse into the wider world of the Clinton Machine and one of the people charged with running it. ?If Podesta had been more careful in his email practices, that may not have happened.',fake

'Not that the viewers of cop shows for the last decade didn?t know this, but United States law enforcement shares resources. ?Especially when identification is needed, the ?good guys with the guns? look through all sorts of databases for pictures of Americans looking for a match. ?Mug shots, driver?s licenses, internet?our faces are everywhere, and the government can find out if your face is in any picture, anytime if your face is already in one of these databases.A study conducted by Georgetown Law?s Center on Privacy and Technology found that while the system does not sit with any one law enforcement entity, the information sharing has the effect of half of the country being in the system.?Looking at the sum total of what we found, there have been no laws that comprehensively regulate face recognition technology, and there?s really no case law either,? Clare Garvie, an associate at the CPT, told Vocativ. ?So we find ourselves having to rely on the agencies that are using that technology to rein it in. But what we found is that not every system ? by a long shot ? has a use policy.?Meaning that with no laws governing the system as it stands, the entire network is open to abuse regardless of its usefulness in fighting crime and finding criminals.That so many American adults are in at least one facial recognition database is largely due to the fact that at least 26 states, and likely more, share their Department of Motor Vehicles databases with the FBI, state police, or other law enforcement agencies, the study found. Compounded with that, police often have access to mugshot databases. Garvie?s study found that most law enforcement agencies don?t purge such records, even if the arrested suspect is found not guilty, unless a court orders it. The sole known exception is the Michigan State Police, which does expunge photos after a set amount of time?.?These systems are used on law-abiding Americans without their knowledge or consent in most cases,? Garvie said.How that fits into a law and order society has yet to be determined. ?The law has not caught up to technology in this case. According to the study, a full quarter of law enforcement agencies in the United States have access to the system with a facial recognition center that has software to help them out.The West Virginia Fusion Center, for example, a Charleston-based coalition of federal and local law enforcement, possesses software that matches individuals in video footage with a database of still photographs. Not only does it share information with the FBI, West Virginia State Police, and city and county departments, it may grant access to 77 other fusion centers across the country.In a country where privacy is supposedly assured, law and order is a way of life, and search and seizure is supposed to be done only via warrant, this is terrifying. ?Who knows how such information and ability can be used and abused by authorities.

'Mumbai: From the latest TRP ratings published, one unusual observation has come to our notice.?If we add the TRPs claimed by different TV channels for a particular time slot, it is going more than 200 percent which is baffling to say the least.?First thing most of the TV channels will say they do not believe in these TRP data, then they threaten to boycott it from next time. However, after one channel starts putting advertisement how they topped in certain prime hour duration, others follow,? said media observer R. Shankar while speaking to us.?I took prime time duration 8 PM to 10 PM time slot for my analysis. Added the TRPs claimed by the news channels. It is 218 percent. How on earth this is possible?? said Mr. Shankar who decided to meet the heads of this channel before exposing this farce. After meeting the TV channel heads Mr. Shankar got a clue how these TV channels present the data to its advantage. ?Though Rating was given for hour basis, TV channels claim they collect data per every second. So, what happens is they extract the best data and present it in a way to claim how they are on top. Of course, if I look data for a particular second and add them, the sum total comes cent percent,? said Mr. Shankar on the realities behind TRP business.When Shankar questioned them saying this is not fair. TV channel heads told me as per the guidelines they put * marks with disclaimer below which people should try to read. For that to do you need to pause your TV which should be of 102 inch or above. The recommended font size for disclaimers is 5 or below.We noticed a TV channel which showed only advertisement during a particular time period, claims in that period maximum people watched its hard-hitting debate show it conducts.

Among liberal-identifying whites, support is shifting from Hillary (-27 since October?1st) to Donald Trump (78\%) or Jill Stein (21\%).As for what to do come election day should Hillary need a little help, these operations are NOT RECOMMENDED:Yes, it seems the Project Vertias warnings were not out of line.For the full report, follow this link before it disappears. ?Hopefully, the anonymous source survives.Like all things politics, this could be a red herring, or it could be why We the People are being gaslighted with no end in sight.H/T ? daisyluther.com (as of this writing, the page disappeared)',fake
'Normally the corrupt Democrats will bus in some union groups or paid actors pretending to be Clinton supporters to fill the seats and stands. They at least attempt to make it a little less obvious that nobody outside of the elites, Hollywood, entertainers, financial parasites, globalists and establishment hierarchy supports their criminal ticket. Somebody within the campaign apparently messed up. It was this past Monday, so at a minimum the unions should have been able to get their unprincipled minions over to affirm their undying love and support for the evil one or her running mate. What happened?At what point does a rally become something else, like just a few guys hanging out or ?chillin with the freak?? While Kaine is undoubtedly not the kind of guy you?d give a spare house key to and tell to ?drop in anytime,? they are supposed to be able to tolerate him at least for the duration of a campaign speech.Beyond mere tolerance, is there an enthusiasm requirement for a designation of a gathering as a rally or is the presence of a finite number of bodies in possession of a pulse sufficient? By these standards my last visit to DMV was ??rousing? and ?electric.?You know your campaign is in trouble when Kaine, the man designated to be president when Clinton finally can?t hide her health any longer or drops dead can only draw about thirty people to an event. Security is unsurpassed for this West Palm Beach, FL, event, as the ratio of Secret Service agents to attendees appears to be about four to one. It might even be better than that as some of those attendees are likely plain clothes officers as well. For all we know there were no attendees, only Kaine, his promoters and his protectors.It?s much more than he needs in the way of security. With his party being the one that conducts the dirty tricks and thuggery and no civilians even aware of his existence, he?s not in any danger. It?s okay, though, the Clintons? have plenty of other people?s money to throw away on security and everything else, including bribes and lots of false, negative ads.Clearly that isn?t enough. The American people seem to have figured out their scam. They?ve got something better to do than stand around and be lied to by weird little elf people. You?d expect to see more people than this at a typical five-year-old?s birthday party.BREAKING: #TimKaine rally only about 30 people show up.

'BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra has shifted to the Republic TV office situated in Lower Parel to save his time spent travelling to the studio for the debate every night.Earlier this month, Sambit had requested Republic TV editor-in-chief, Arnab Goswami, to allot him some space in the office premises so that he can shift there permanently along with his family members.Confirming the news, Sambit said, ?It took me a lot of time and effort to travel to Republic TV studio for the debate every day. Arnab and I belong to the same party? oops! I mean, we go to a lot of parties together. So, he had to do me a favour by giving me and my family some space in his office. After all, I have been the most consistent thing on the debate after the noise.? He further added that Arnab has stood by him like a rock, ?This is not the first time that Arnab has helped me. Many a times on the debate, he speaks exactly what I intend to, which reduces my responsibilities as a spokesperson of the BJP,? he said, thanking Arnab. Meanwhile, the spokespersons of the Congress party who had allegedly boycotted the Republic TV debates were seen queuing outside the news channel?s office. One of the spokespersons said, ?With the high rates of property in Mumbai, it is really difficult to find an appropriate house in the city. We are ready to appear in Republic TV debates again if Arnab allows us to stay in his office like he allowed Sambit,? he said. He clarified that he will not be bringing his family along with him to the office. ?My son has frequent exams in his school. Given the high decibels in Republic TV studio, my son will not be able to concentrate in studies,? he said.Arnab confirmed the news when our reporter spoke to him: ?IT?S TRUE. I CAN?T REALLY EXPRESS MY EXCITEMENT TO HAVE SAMBIT ONBOARD. THIS IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME SINCE 2014 AFTER MODI JI?S VICTORY,? he shouted. ',fake
'4th Nov,2017.?After the derailment of trains, another case of carelessness from Indian Railways has come to light. A defective tomato sachet caused havoc in the life of a 26-year old girl, Sukriti, going to her home. When Sukriti got seated in chair car bogie of Malpua Express, she had no idea of what is going to happen in this journey.Sukriti received morning tea around 7 am in the morning, moments after she got seated. After about an hour, she got her breakfast. Please note that we have been giving Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains, an extra penny for this meal since decades. After finishing the breakfast, unable to make space for the sauce in her stomach, Sukriti decided to put that sachet in her bag where all other sachets have been stored from previous visits at various places.What happened thereafter, will blow your mind and make you cry. Keep tissues handy. After about an hour, when she opened the bag for putting another sachet of jam to store at the same place, she found leaked sauce scattered all over her bag. It took a good 30 minutes before she could restore back the situation.Such incidents show the carelessness of Indian Railways and also highlight the plight of passengers .Railway authorities should take this matter into serious hands, before it impacts the life of another Sukriti.',fake
'Tomi Lahren reminds Americans that it is very important that they vote. She reiterates she?s addressing Americans and explains that she isn?t speaking to either dead people or invaders who barged into this country illegally. She notes that while they are accustomed to having their butts wiped by Obama and Hillary Clinton, that special treatment doesn?t include the right to vote.She points out the Democrat fraud, they are the party of criminals, after all, includes 2.8 million who are registered to vote in two or more states and 1.8 million who, although they are registered to vote, are actually deceased.Lahren points out that in 2008 over six percent of non-citizens were able to vote, a number which was the difference in getting their current fellow illegal squatter elected. She advocates for voter ID laws although there is obviously not enough time at this late stage in the game for us to do much beyond some intensive poll watching and the associated challenges.DHS Secretary and illegal alien enabler Jihadi Jeh Johnson has been promoting the idea that the election will be hacked so there?s little doubt the Democrats have something in the works, some form of illegality to put their criminal into office, likely an assortment of attacks across not only polling sites but elsewhere.She reminds us of the ludicrous arguments of the left against protecting the integrity of the electoral process, the claims that voter ID laws ?disenfranchise voters and hamper the minority vote. She asks the question many of us have given up trying to get an answer to because their simply is none, saying, ?I still don?t get how showing a driver?s license or ID card to vote is in any way racist or exclusionary.?Ms. Lahren says, ?If you need an ID to buy Sudafed, get into a bar, cash a check or board an airplane, you sure as hell need one to vote for our next president. This is common sense and if the Dems don?t like that, well, that tells you everything you need to know about that party.?She mentions that the IDs are also free for those who can?t afford one, asking, ?Since when have Democrat voters ever had a hard time accepting a free thing.

'Now it?s official. If you don?t admire emperor Obama?s new clothes, his ?Air, Dir, and Water Nazi,? Gina McCarthy, has decided you no longer are worthy of her time. According to her the discussion is finished, her side won, the fairy tale is real and those who insist on living in the real world, alarmism deniers, have now ceased to exist. Her boss, Hussein Obama has empowered the little witch through his own declaration that the ?science? is settled.The EPA troll announced in a Facebook interview with Mashable on Tuesday, that she?s done talking to ?climate deniers,? displaying the typical open-mindedness that is so characteristic of the global government shills.In falsely presenting her case as being grounded in reason, ?McCarthy said, ?If they haven?t figured out by now, what in God?s name could anyone say to them?? Conversely, one could ask the same questions of the dirt worshipers.She continued, ?I don?t check out flat Earth society and I?m not talking to climate deniers. That?s it. Sorry, I know I?m supposed to be for everybody, but my patience has worn thin over eight years.?Actually, McCarthy, nobody has ever accused an EPA chief of being for anybody other than the Democrat NWO, so don?t worry your manly little head over it. Nobody has ever gotten a straight or honest answer from this manipulative subversive either, though she?s had eight years of non-stop attacks on the American people and our nation in which to offer one. We?re paying tax dollars to be dictated to, demeaned and have our country destroyed in the name of complete and utter lies, nonsense, idiocy and corruption. She thinks she?s lost her patience?She attempts to defend her agency?s war on coal, and the economic disasters that they have inflicted upon ordinary Americans. Although it?s something that Hussein Obama announced prior to his taking the office he now holds, McCarthy said, ?This is not something that happened over the past administration.? While the Bush and Clinton administrations were no friends of the American people, to say that the damage has not increased exponentially under her and Obama would be a false statement on par with equating erosion with the the mythical rising sea levels.The Daily Caller notes that in a June 2015 speech, McCarthy stated that, ?normal people,? not global warming skeptics, would win the climate debate. Of course normal people and global warming skeptics are one in the same. In fairness to McCarthy, she probably only associates herself with other Democrats and complicit establishment Republicans. It?s hard to recognize a?normal person?when all you have is EPA sycophants as your points of reference.In that speech she also stated, ?I am doing that not to push back on climate deniers. (the normal folks) You can have fun doing that if you want, but I?ve batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasn?t changed their mind it never will.?The evidence of that ?head batting? has been manifesting itself with increased frequency in the policies of the regime since they first hit town, in 2009.

'Conservative activist Trevor Loudon was a guest on ?Breitbart News Daily? Monday morning, offering the ominous prediction of what will result if Hillary Clinton is allowed to take possession of the White House. Whether she actually gets a higher vote count or not, whether she is placed into office by the elites through fraud, it won?t matter.This will effectively be our last election. She?s already promised that within the first 100 days she intends to make the illegals citizens through some hook or crook form of executive dictatorial action. It will be the corrupt Democrat state controlling everything from that point on, with nothing, not even a facade of an opposition party to stand in her way.Trevor Loudon informs the audience that ?Hillary Clinton is intimately involved in UN resolution 1618, which has been promoted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world?s largest NGO, which is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood. That resolution criminalizes criticism of Islam worldwide, including the United States. That will directly go against your First Amendment.? What he doesn?t say specifically is that it will also be a huge step in the direction of the imposition of Sharia Law in the North American Caliphate.?She?ll obviously use the Supreme Court to shut down the First and Second Amendment.? He continues, saying, ?I just want to make one big point. She has promised within 100 days of assuming office to legalize all of the illegal immigrants in the United States. Now that?s anywhere between 12 and 50 million people. We know from past patterns that they will vote between 75 and 80 percent Democrat. If she does that there will never be another Republican president, ever or anyone other than a Democrat. You?ll have effectively a one party state in America.?Loudon warns, ?Now if you think Obama was a totalitarian, you imagine Hillary Clinton with no effective Republican opposition ever. She will just go hardcore to strip all of your rights. Hillary Clinton is an ideological Marxist. People have to understand that. She?s worked with the communist movement her entire life. She works extensively with the Muslim Brotherhood.? He points also to her subversive actions with the Russians, those same people she and Obama are supposedly at war with, the ones she sold our Uranium to.He asks how the nevertrump traitors will rebuild the conservative movement after sitting out the current election when they?ve put someone in power that will flood the nation with Democrats.

'Under normal circumstances, this writer would be reluctant to post a forty-six minute video of any sort, but we live in extra-ordinary times, and today, Donald Trump put on a clinic in how to fight back when libeled by one of the American major dailies.The ?story? (face it, Dems, libs, progressives and feminists, it was a fairy tale ? and a fractured one at that) hit the New York Times on the evening of Wednesday, October 12. ?Supposedly, Donald Trump misbehaved sexually on a long flight and in the first class cabin. ?Several members of the flying public debunked the details, and Trump himself immediately demanded a retraction with the threat of legal action. ?Other women who have come in contact with Trump now are alleging similar misconduct.In today?s speech in West Palm Beach, Florida, a visibly furious Donald Trump took these people, and their tactics, apart. ?Noting that none of these women ever presses charges or complained about any of the ?misconduct? before now, The Donald defended himself in a way that had the crowd cheering him on.One report this writer read claims that Trump fumed all night. ?Being an opera singer, I am here to tell you that in exhaustion, and fury, the first thing to go is the voice. ?In the video below, Trump?s voice is showing evidence that he was up all night. ?It?s tired. ?But, he can?t give up. ?There?s too much at stake.After about twenty minutes, Trump tacks to actual policy and the Clinton/Obama record on foreign policy among other topics, but when it comes down to it, when he says that the great editors and founders of the New York Times and other publications have to be spinning in their graves at the scandalous activities done by reporters both in plain sight and as revealed by a whole lot of leaked John Podesta emails, he?s not kidding.Grab a beverage and put your feet up. ?This is good.?',fake
'?The Clinton?s are criminals, remember that, they are criminals,? were the words that brought cheers and chants of ?lock her up? as Donald Trump addressed the huge crowd gathered to hear him speak Thursday in West Palm Beach, FL. This was one of the best speeches of this campaign.Trump said at the 1:15 point, early in his speech, ?There is nothing that the political establishment will not do, no lie that they won?t tell, to hold their prestige and power at your expense, and that?s what?s been happening. The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund them, exist for only one reason, to protect and enrich itself.??The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election,? he said. ?As an example, just one single trade deal they?d like to pass involves trillions of dollars, controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don?t have your good in mind.??Our campaign represents a true existential threat like they haven?t seen before.? Mr. Trump points out, ?This is not simply another four year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.?He tells his supporters that the same people who are trying so desperately to derail his campaign are the same ones responsible for the problems that plague us, all of them brought about by their criminality and conflicts of interest, actions which have ?bled our country dry.?At about the 5:00 minute mark he notes how the Clinton machine is at the center of the global system and how the Clintons meet in secret to plot the destruction of US sovereignty. He?s not exaggerating. Globalization is the elimination of borders and that means the death of our nation.At the 8:15 point he says, ?The corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with a total political agenda. And the agenda is not for you, it?s for themselves.?At the 8:50 mark he points out that this is war and the fascist establishment power bloc will do anything that is required for them to win. He makes some very powerful comments about this being our last chance to save our nation, on November 8th. Forget your brainwashing since your youth, America.

'Even the Obama apologists at CNN can?t change reality to hide the truth as much as Hillary Clinton would like, or deflect the real damage the truth could cause her campaign. Obamacare increases of their admitted 26 percent will be bad enough, but Donald Trump says that?s the deceptive good news. The inaccurate, overly generous good news. ?If you like your 26 percent increase you can keep your 26 percent increase? is a hard sell to make, given Obama?s track record. The real amount of increases will be much higher.\r\nAccording to the government report released on Monday, those are the numbers. But that?s the corrupt Obama government and it is not to be believed. Trump sees increases more than doubling in some states, such as Arizona where premiums will rise by 116 percent. He names many others who are experiencing significant increases in premiums and deductibles and decreases in coverage.\r\n\r\nThe weak reporters at CNN blame ?sicker-than-anticipated? customers, an admission by any insurance company that they?re not doing a very good job of risk management and analysis. How could all of the insurers have failed at such a basic and critical function simultaneously? It?s not likely that they did. There?s a little trickery involved somewhere. Maybe the inevitable and intentional failure to force us into a single payer socialist system is at work.\r\nCNN also stated that Insurers want to see younger and healthier consumers enroll. Of course they do, and of course they won?t. But don?t blame Obama, Clinton, Pelosi or any of the other Democrats who forced this disaster through while demanding their colleagues pass it sight unseen. Actually blame all of them, they?re all responsible. Every yes vote belonged to a guilty co-conspirator.\r\n\r\nCNN presses the Marxist health care position, stating ?Most consumers, however, are shielded from these price hikes, especially if they return to the exchanges to shop after enrollment opens Nov. 1. Some 85\% of Obamacare enrollees receive federal subsidies, which can lower their premium to less than 10\% of their income.?\r\nDoes that mean that the costs simply vanish into thin air or that they will be assumed by the American public at large in a manner that eventually results in socialized medicine, just as Obama, Clinton and Soros demand? Trump knows what?s going on. He?s going to expose it so that just maybe the sheeple following the liars on the left will start to think for themselves and question the false narrative.\r\nSure, start with health care folks, but there?s so much more. Do you know what open borders, TPP and surrender to the climate hoax are going to do to us economically? Do you really want to go to war so that the Clinton cronies can make a quick buck?

'Donald Trump followed up his superior debate performance in Las Vegas with a speech on Thursday in Ohio. He started by cleaning up a little unfinished business from the night before. Mr. Trump announced to his crowd in attendance and to the nation ?that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election ? if I win. With that he pointed to the crowd and broke into a huge grin. Maybe the media jackals will get the joke, odds are they won?t.Trump acknowledged that the question of voter fraud came up during the debate. He said, ?We want fairness in the election. This is having nothing to do with me but having to do with the future of our country. We have to have fairness. He then quotes the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta as saying in emails revealed by WikiLeaks, ?Illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver?s license. What I?m saying is don?t be naive folks, don?t be naive.?Trump noted, ?One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton campaign has paid people to disrupt violently our rallies and to insight absolute, total bedlam.? Chants of ?lock her up? broke out in the crowd. Trump says, ?You know I?ve had occasions where we had rallies and it was so incredibly violent, I said, ?What?s going on over here?? These were paid people by the Clinton campaign and it just came out, and I give a lot of credit to the people that brought this out, believe me.??This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition,? says Trump, ?of peaceful democratic elections.? A campaign like Clinton?s, that will incite violence, is truly a campaign that will do anything to win.? He points to a long list of examples noting that committing voter fraud has to be included. Trump also points out that Clinton had been given a question word for word by DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile while she was working at CNN.After referencing the pressure on Brazile to resign as DNC chair following the release of the information, Trump asks why shouldn?t Clinton also be required to resign. He says, ?Think of it, she was given these questions, she used these questions, studied the questions, got the perfect answer for the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally wrong and inappropriate; hence the name, Crooked Hillary.Her corruption is magnified in that she is running for the presidency, she should have reported the ?mistake? but once again, just as with her criminal email arrangement, she didn?t. Trump announced, ?Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt and dishonest person ever to seek the office of the presidency. So it?s in that context that I was asked a question about whether I would agree in advance to concede the results on election night, if for some reason we should lose, which we?re not going to lose.?He describes the unprecedented question, the attempt to concede the results in advance and commit to accepting their fraud and to waive protections provided by our system of government to the voters. That?s why Obama has been making arguments about the need to ?stop whining? and accept the results. He and Hillary Clinton have both been working through the DNC to commit election fraud and they would like nothing better than to force their opponent to comply with their manipulated false results.Trump goes on to point out many of the flaws in the system, many of them purposely engineered into it by Democrats and Republicans alike to manipulate the results of elections, to do exactly what the Clinton camp is doing right now. He cites statistics for illegal aliens voters registered, dead voters registered and voters registered in multiple states.America has a system of laws that are triggered in the event of fraud or in the event of a recount where it?s needed. He says, ?Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.He promises to put America first to chants of ?USA.?Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Trump: The age old battle between good and evil is continuing in the US election to determine the next, and perhaps the last, president of our once great nation. If Hillary Clinton is elected, regardless of the specifics of how the events play out, she will likely be the last American president, at least in this incarnation of America.The subordination of the United States to international authority is at the top of their agenda and they will use force if given the opportunity to subjugate or attempt to subjugate the American people. If Donald Trump is elected, that hot war is just beginning, but we live to fight another day and our nation has a chance at survival.The gloves are off and it is becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump knows the true nature of the enemy. He?s now saying so in his rallies. Many of his attendees are patriots who have been aware of the globalist intrusions as they occurred; many likely understood the threat before he did. Now we?re all coming together as one combined fighting force, the liberators of our nation from the world government kleptocrats who have seized power.On Tuesday night Mr. Trump made several references to the true nature of the ?evil empire? the establishment anti-American forces which occupy many high positions in both parties, which he has now declared war upon. Rep Paul Ryan has been identified by Mr. Trump as the face of the evil empire, a distinction he shares with Hillary Clinton.He told a crowd of approximately 8,000 people in Panama City Beach, FL that Hillary Clinton is full of ?so much corruption.? He repeated his declaration of Sunday?s debate that he would be obligated to order a criminal probe into her corruption, both during and following her State Department tenure.Trump said, ?We have to investigate Hillary Clinton, and we have to investigate the investigation! She was a disaster and she?s a bad person. Remember that. She?s a bad, bad person.?Over half of Mr. Trump?s nearly hour long speech was composed of new material, much of it content that originated in WikiLeaks documents. The latest are the emails of Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta who is also a fat cat lobbyist and former senior adviser to Hussein Obama.Mr. Trump understands the plotting against the American people, the treason engaged in by the Obama White House, Hillary Clinton, Jeh Johnson, John Kerry and Valerie Jarrett. He understands and is vocalizing the reality that they are attacking this nation with the specific objective of destroying it.Trump said of his opponent, ?Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, again just revealed, Hillary said ?My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.? Well, there goes the rest of your businesses. And there goes your country, folks.?He added, ?Behind closed doors when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. No borders! If you don?t have borders, we don?t have a country.??WikiLeaks has given us a window into the secret corridors of government power,? Trump said, ?where we see a former secretary of state announcing her desire to end forever the American independence that our founders gave to us and wanted us to have. American soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America?s freedom, and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to these open borders, open trade, and a world government.?He noted, ?We?re protecting the borders of foreign countries, but not our borders. These WikiLeaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel of a corrupt globalist establishment that?s raiding our country and surrendering the sovereignty of our nation.?He added, ?This criminal government cartel doesn?t recognize borders but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration and rule by corporations.?Mr. Trump understands that America is under siege, that the attempted conquest of our nation from within started at least in the first Bush administration and likely long before that, and has been being implemented progressively ever since. It has continued through both Democrat and Republican administrations, with the pace quickening significantly under the current Obama regime.We?re in a war, at least we have found a leader who is willing to take off the shackles and fight back. It?s a fight for our futures, for our families, for our nation and for good over evil, that we all need to join him in.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Donald Trump says that the election system is rigged. ?Guess what. ?He?s right.In the battle for the mind of the American voter, not much is used more often than polls. ?When building up a winner, it is vital to make it LOOK like one side or the other is winning. ?No one wants to be associated with a loser, so part of the publicity strategy is to create the image that one side or the other is winning or losing.In order to make it look like Democrats, in particular, are winning, the coalition of people that includes John Podesta and his tribe of Hillary Helpers came up with a way to make the polls, at least, appear to have their candidates up. ?It?s called oversampling, and the method is used to plump up percentages. ?From Zero Hedge via The Gateway Pundit.?For all of you out there who still aren?t convinced that the polls are ?adjusted?, we present to you the following Podesta email, leaked earlier today, that conveniently spells out, in detail, exactly how to ?manufacture? the desired data. The email starts out with a request for recommendations on ?oversamples for polling? in order to ?maximize what we get out of our media polling.?That particular email is accompanied by a guide that tells of specific over sampling strategies PER STATE. ?For example, in Florida, sampling first happens in Orlando and Tampa where the people are more friendly to Democrats. ?Arizona oversamples with Hispanics. ?The idea is to make the candidate more popular than he or she really is.Reverse strategies are used to bring down the opponent. ?Sneaky, huh?',fake
'Robert and Rebekah Mercer are mega-donors who are recognized as two of the most influential figures associated with the Trump campaign. They were previously also backing Ted Cruz although his less-than-gracious refusal to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican convention may have ended that relationship forever. There are financial consequences for significant violations of their code of conduct. Some had feared the video of eleven years ago might have met that threshold.Mr. Mercer and his daughter did not become billionaires by being ignorant or by being poor judges of character. They have a?talent?that is unique among those of considerable means; an ability to recognize what this country truly needs and a willingness to look with insight beyond the pandering and fulfillment of short term self-interest.They recognize that Donald Trump is the solution to what ails this nation and were not persuaded by the many cowards, frauds, establishment hacks and political harlots who are serving their masters and covering their own disingenuous backsides by attacking or severing ties with the Republican nominee.On Friday the Mercers issued the following statement through the Washington Post, the paper which initially broke the anti-Trump video in service to their mistress, Hillary Clinton.?If Mr. Trump had told Billy Bush, whoever that is, earlier this year that he was for open borders, open trade, and executive actions in pursuit of gun control, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. If he had admitted to Mr. Bush that he had profited privately by allowing the sale to Russia of 20\% of US uranium deposits or that he had amassed his personal fortune not by hard work in the private sector but by selling favors to foreigners on the American taxpayers? dime, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. If he had argued that he needed both a public and a private position on issues facing the American public, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him. And finally if Trump had serially terrorized and silenced the victims of violent sexual assault whom he feared could damage his political career, we would most definitely be rethinking our support for him.?Donald Trump?s uncensored comments, both old and new, have been echoed and dissected in the media repeatedly in an effort to kindle among his supporters a conflagration of outrage commensurate with the media?s own faux outrage. Can anyone really be surprised that Mr. Trump could have said to Mr. Bush such things as he has already admitted saying? No. We are completely indifferent to Mr. Trump?s locker room braggadocio.?The same media that resolutely looked away when the most powerful man in the world, a sitting U.S. president with multiple violent sexual assaults to his credit, snared an impressionable young intern in his web and ruined her life, now expects us to gasp with revulsion at Mr. Trump?s irreverent comments. America is finally fed up and disgusted with its political elite. Trump is channeling this disgust and those among the political elite who quake before the boom box of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces on November 8th. We have a country to save and there is only one person who can save it. We, and Americans across the country and around the world, stand steadfastly behind Donald J. Trump.?Are you getting the message Paul Ryan and the rest of you cheap political tarts? Your days are numbered.

'In what might be a keep your friends close and your enemies closer move, President-Elect Donald Trump named his first Chief of Staff on Sunday, November 13. ?The political appointee is none other than Republican National Committee Chairman, Reince Priebus.In addition to the GOP front man, Trump also named?Steve Bannon, executive chairman of Breitbart News ?and Trump campaign CEO, as a chief strategist and senior counselor. ?From CNN:Video from Newsy.The move to pair these two political operatives from opposite sides of the Republican spectrum is seen as an effort to comfort the GOP rank and file and the nontrusting, Deplorable wing more interested in draining the swamp of Washington, D.C., than preserving any sort of political continuity let over from the previous administrations.Priebus was widely regarded as one of the people who laid the groundwork for a Republican victory for president in 2016 via deconstruction of the 2012 election, and his efforts to hold the party together despite the dissent of many when the primaries produced Trump as the nominee. ?Bannon is known to have been one of the two finalists for the Chief of Staff position. ?His appointment as a special adviser indicates Trump?s trust in him, and possibly an interest from the Mercer family, owners of Breitbart, who switched allegiance from Sen.

'Some political observers would say, ?IT?S ABOUT TIME!? that Donald Trump is putting out hard hitting, anti-Hillary advertising in the last week of the presidential election campaign. ?In this case, timing may be everything, as well as placement since these ads are running not just at any time of day or night, but during the World Series. ?(Given this year?s competitors, the Series has amazingly high ratings.)However, when it comes to the Clintons, and the hubris that leads to scandal and headlines, sometimes waiting until the last moment for maximum impact is the way to go. ?That may be the thinking behind the newest ad from Trump and the Republican National Committee. ?It?s called ?Clinton Corruption? and it hits all the major points.Yes, the Clintons got rich off of their ?foundation? that was set up as some sort of money laundering scheme for pay to play politics while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. Yes, they charged outrageous speaking fees, as prominent people are wont to do, to appear at any number of venues. ?Yes, their email system ? hers anyway ? was illegal for the way it was used. ?This is not news.The reality that the FBI is looking into it in five different field offices?that cannot be ignored.My fellow Americans, we are in the home stretch of a brutal election year. ?Usually at the end, the campaigns are out of cash and are scraping to actually afford effective advertising in time slots where people will actually see it. ?By not spending any cash early, and riding on Mainstream Media coverage ? good or bad ?

'In a campaign stop in Johnstown, PA, Donald Trump took a few moments to draw attention to what he identified as ?the dishonest people in the media,? noting that they play a large role in the rigging of the system.Trump gives what he?s saying a little time to soak in and observes the interaction between his supporters and the dishonest Clinton supporters he had just identified. He says, ?Isn?t it amazing how, you know, they don?t even want to look at you folks. I think they consider you, like Hillary they consider you deplorable and irredeemable also.?He continues, saying, ?By the way, tonight when you go home and watch this on television, the only people you?re going to see,? as he turns around an points directly behind him. The members of his crowd positioned there break into applause as Trump turns back around, shaking his head and saying, ?The only people they?ll show.??No, they?re not going to show the record-setting crowds,? says Trump. ?They?re going to show the people [in] back but, you know what, their seat isn?t as good. But they?re going to become more famous because of this.?He forms a little viewfinder box with his hands, mimicking the small segment of the huge crowds that they allow to be seen. The only part of the popularity argument that they can?t falsify are the crowds. They can lie about poll numbers, control the messaging in the media, focus on the unimportant while ignoring Clinton?s disqualifying crimes, medical conditions, judgment and lack of moral character, but they can?t fake the bodies in the seats. Their answer is to not show the huge Trump crowds, to remove it from part of the landscape.Trump knows what they?re up to and he?s got a plan to get around their inherent dishonesty. He asks, ?Can somebody act out being a protester so the cameras will all move over? He immediately has a volunteer in the audience so Trump announces to the media people, ?There?s a protester, there?s a protester. The only time they move those cameras?oh look, there?s a protester, look,? as another volunteer takes up the challenge. ?A third volunteer steps up to which Trump responds, ?There?s another protester.He adds, ?These people are the worst.?

'Trump Supporters at a Trump rally in Cincinnati, OH, the patriots who showed up to hear Mr. Trump speak and to show their support also had a message for the corrupt Hillary Clinton propagandists who laughably call themselves journalists, the mainstream media.The lying liberal implements of deception were greeted by approximately 20,000 Americans who are fed up with their lies and their naked attempts to silence their voices and manipulate the outcome of the election. The media has demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt that they work for the globalists backing Clinton, that?s who they want to see elected, that is who they are being paid to promote and they will do virtually anything to make it happen. Ethics and journalistic integrity are of no concern to any of them.\r\nThe rally was held last Thursday but they certainly don?t seem to have learned anything, their reporting is still as corrupt and anti-American as ever. As the political street walkers entered the arena, a loud chorus of spontaneous boos erupted throughout the entire building. The attendees were chanting ?tell the truth,? and ?CNN sucks,? which was recorded by InfoWars reporter, Millie Weaver.She asks a couple of the media people, who appear to be making a hasty exit in the face of an angry public, ?How does it feel to have been called out by thousands of Americans for being lying and corrupt?? Neither answered as both seemed much more concerned with their personal security than with offering their input. Weaver commented on that aspect as well, saying, ?You could see the fear on some of these guys? faces in the media, in the mainstream media.America is fighting back, we?ve had enough. The criminal syndicate that has hijacked our nation doesn?t play by the same rules we do. It?s time we take our own handcuffs off and let them know that we?ve done so. Demanding that these charlatans actually conduct themselves as journalists and report both sides of the issues is a start.Public disdain for their corruption and lack of character is something that now comes with their territory, something that can?t be good for advertising revenue. Just where will Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper go to work when CNN and MSNBC are no more? No matter where they go, nobody is going to watch them. That is how we win in the long term.

We Americans have had enough of the charade; we?re not fooled. The illusion of the two party, left-right paradigm is well known, Republicans and Democrats are tools of the same elites. This is not even a government any longer. It is an oppressive, exploitative criminal organization.Paul Ryan is a traitorous political whore put into power by the elites as their operative in a negotiated deal. The so-called ?Freedom Caucus? of the House was at best naively persuaded to ?trust him? because he spoke to them rather than down at them and made them feel important. It?s not unlike the embarrassing ecstasy liberal Sally Field experienced when she suddenly realized that the members of the Motion Picture Academy really liked her. How liked do you foolish boys feel now? Some are probably quite pleased with themselves and their traitorous leader, Paul Ryan, being of the same sleazy stock.The entire state of Utah, it seems, is in the grips of a power-mad Mormon cartel that is a strong faction of the establishment kleptocracy. Is there some sort of underhanded fulfillment of Joseph Smith?s prophecy at play here, a role Ted Cruz was supposed to be playing? Most Mormons are great people, but their Church does exercise tremendous influence and they are, apparently quite willing to abuse their firm grip on power and their control. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) was the orchestrator of the TPP, the international arrangement that cedes US sovereignty to the globalist regional government. Former governor Jon Huntsman, who is also a former Ambassador to China under Hussein Obama and a GOP globalist candidate for president in 2012 is helping to spearhead that betrayal.Huntsman?s puppy dog, Senator Mike Lee, whom he threatened with a primary challenge if he didn?t obey orders prior to his last election, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Paul Ryan?s number one leg-humper, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, have all joined in one last-ditch effort to have Mr. Trump kicked off of the ticket. What?s going on in Utah? How can a state built by Mormons, who have a history of polygamy and the forced marriage of young girls against their will to much older men, have suddenly found themselves occupants of a holier-than-thou moral high ground? Have they all?self-righteously qualified themselves to throw the fist stone?Then there?s their demi-god, Mitt Romney, the voice of the neverTrump movement. It should more accurately be called the anti-America or neverAmerica movement, because Trump represents us and our future and they are targeting the nation through him. A failure to elect Donald Trump will complete the transformation of our nation from a country that is governed by the people to one that is governed by corporate fascists. We?re almost there now but there?s just a few more finishing touches that Hillary Clinton needs to add to make it official.Calls for Mike Pence to step in like a modern day Gerald Ford are just a way for the establishment types to offer an acceptable, palatable replacement for?Trump. He?s one that most Republicans, they falsely believe, would? accept as an alternative, and ?the guy we should have picked in the first place.? Nobody wanted Gerald Ford after they ran Nixon off and we don?t want Mike Pence as an imitation Donald Trump.We chose Trump, whether the ?neverAmerica? crowd likes it or is willing to accept him or not. That?s who we intend to have as our president, imperfect as he is. Once again, through his imperfections, Trump has shown he?s just like us, he?s a regular American; he?s real.The establishment would be comfortable with a candidate who was slinking around in Chicago bath houses with other men or in Miami bubble bath hot tubs. They?d be keeping those things hush-hush because they would cement their power. Trump can?t be blackmailed and he may even have known these revelations would be coming out. They may have tried to coerce him into quitting prior to their release but he would have no part of it.Trump is not a quitter and we?re not quitting on him or on our nation. We?re not going to surrender the United States to the forces of the evil establishment. The fight is on. Unlike the regime we have no problem identifying and vocalizing our enemy. It?s Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, the Republican establishment and the globalist, anti-American oligarchs.As Rowdy Roddy Piper announced to a bank full of thinly disguised globalists in the classic scene from the movie They Live, ?I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I?m all out of bubble gum.?

'If ever there was a microcosm of the Trump vs. The Media row that permeates the America first movement manifesting in the United States, the simple request Donald Trump asked of the cameras at a rally in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania is it. ?Watch what happens when The Donald asks the people operating the cameras to show the crowd.In the video, multiple cameras did move, but the majority did not. ?The camera angles are generally concentrating on Trump himself, and what he says, trying to catch him in some sort of gaffe. ?The narrative pushed by the lying mainstream media is that Hillary Clinton is leading in the polling, and Trump?s train is losing steam. ?From the non-mainstream media sources, and witnesses to the rallies that make Donald Trump look like the Energizer Bunny, We the People know that lines to get into the events are long, and that the people attending them come from all walks of life.This video is an example of why Donald Trump has taken on the mainstream media, the corporate media, the people for whom authority in order to build ratings is everything. ?For reasons that most people assume have to do with the ownership of the networks, the people charged with keeping the public informed are telling a version of reality that does not exist ? and thanks to some whistleblower out there who provided WikiLeaks with tens of thousands of Democratic operatives? emails, we know that it is in collusion with the opposition.',fake

Though your dance steps while beating egg did not match the rap. But you can improve on it?, said Judge 1.Kooly thanked and waited for second Judge to respond, who gave him a standing ovation and said he doesn?t have words to describe anything, as dance seemed like shaking coconut tree, while his omelette tastes like shampoo and he sang like ailing animal, but together everything looked like an art just as this show requires.The third judge however asked about more important selection criteria, his backstory. And everything messed up.\r\r\n\r\n?I had a normal life. My family is middle class. My college is average. I don?t know if anything really sad is there in my life?, Kooleshwar said.On further probing, he denied of any specific incident which makes him sad.Shocked judges and TV channel producers had nothing but to reject Kooly.?Kooly had no violence, no parents pressure, no ailing family members, he also had house to live, no injustice.

'Somewhere in Alien-Land: World renowned organization for awarding random things? UNESCO, Which has earlier given awards to India?s National Anthem, National Song, National Prime Minister, President, and what not, has decided to take their work a step further. Today they have decided to award Virat Kohli for the loss against Pakistan. The award for most charitable person, as the organization informs, is given to person who goes out of his duty lines to fulfil the wishes of poor and needy. On 4th of this month, when India beat Pakistan, thousands of television sets in community centers (the only areas presumably in Pakistan where TV sets are found, were broken).Angered at the loss of their property every time India plays Pakistan, the managers of these places had written an emotional letter to Indian team to avoid the watershed beating. Mr. Jaleel Ahmad of Pakistan TV Breaking Fund informed us, ?Pakistan was running short of TV sets to break.??We urge Mr. Kohli and his men to have some mercy, and give us some time to get TV sets, before you beat them next?, he requested.As it is understood, this letter moved Kohli to the core, who also understood that next time India plays Pakistan will be in World Cup 2019. By then, Pakistan would have acquired enough TV sets to again start the routine of breaking. But, was this the reason for India loosing the match?You never know; however, UNESCO considers that it was pre decided by Virat and Indian team to only beat them once the poor country has acquired enough funds to buy those TV sets.After the notification, Officials from Pakistan lended their backing ?to this announcement to award Virat. They are also contemplating to give their highest peace prize to Virat Kohli for understanding the sentiments of poor Pakistanis.',fake
'Unhinged Hillary Clinton?s cackle sometimes seems to serve as a mask for who she really is. For her anything that can hide any aspect of the Clinton composite is surely a benefit. Sometimes the real Clinton slips out, she can?t control herself very well and there are those occasions when cameras are turned on and she?s less than diplomatic. This was on of those situations and may serve as?an eye-opener into what kind of abusive person she really is. There is not shortage of horror stories from former and current Secret Service agents who?ve had the misfortune to have worked her detail. Confidentiality agreements have helped her out lately in keeping her true nature hidden from the public.Clinton demonstrated just how much of a witch, and how sensitive she is about not being given her full due of adoration, by?snapping off the head of a Congolese student during a question and answer session in 2009. He probably thought he?d crafted a really good, liberal-compliant question that was contained enough irrelevant academia-based drivel to make him a superstar back on campus. Instead, he was made to look like an idiot by the evil woman he had misjudged based upon his limited knowledge of who and what she was. If he?d known more he probably would likely have never wasted his time coming to see her.In the aftermath of Clinton?s vicious attack, the State Department attempted to explain her outburst as the result of the questioner?s nervousness. Baloney. What got under her skin was the questioner asking her to provide her husband?s views rather than her own. He said, ?What does Mr. Clinton think through the mouth of Mrs. Clinton??Her building anger is visible on her face at what she takes as a slight to her abilities and status as a manipulative unqualified female. She worked hard manipulating herself into a position she has no business holding and she doesn?t appreciate someone being more interested in the former president?s opinion that hers.Unhinged Hillary was seething as she asked for clarification, saying, ?Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the Secretary of State, I am.? She followed that statement up with a stare, a scornful admonition, and a ?take that and stuff it? sort of hand flip.She added in an extremely arrogant manner, ?You ask my opinion I will tell you my opinion, I?m not going to be channeling my husband.? The look that kills was unleashed a few moments later.?This woman is described by virtually anyone who has had the misfortune to have worked closely with her as a witch, notorious for consistently having these demeaning, hateful outbursts. Combined with her criminality and her treason, it?s difficult to understand why anyone on this earth would support her for any office.

'Vote Trump: Former Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann made a stop on the Rusty Humphries radio program to discuss the presidential campaign and the choice that faces America as well as some of its less-than-honorable citizens.Humphries asked, ?Why do you think the establishment hates Donald Trump so much?? That was an easy answer for Bachmann, who replied, ?I?ll tell you why. It?s because the establishment is all in with moving toward a one-world government. Now that sounds weird, but it?s true. They believe in the idea of no borders and that means that everybody?s incomes will go down and we?ll have a few billionaires across the world.?Bachmann and Humphries point out that Clinton promised Goldman Sachs that she would deliver exactly that to her billionaire supporters. Bachmann continues, saying, ?And the billionaires want to have a one world economic system and a one world political system, so that they get to call the shots and we lose essential freedoms that we?ve taken for granted for years.??That?s the big difference in this election,? Bachmann says, ?Donald Trump still believes in an old-fashioned America where we, the little people, get to vote and have our say. Hillary Clinton is completely different. She?s sold her soul essentially to the Goldman Sachs of the world and that?s who she dances to.

'Plain and simply, Donald Trump is a master of mass communication. ?That has become obvious as the 2016 presidential election season has progressed. ?What few appreciate is what it took for him to get there. ?Yes, there is natural talent involved, but over the decades, The Donald has honed that natural talent to a sharp edge.Part of that training, and something that added tremendously to his name recognition prior to throwing his hat in the presidential ring, was the number of Cameo appearances on television sit-coms and dramas and in movies over the years. ?Thanks to YouTube channel CH2, we now have a compilation.Let?s see what we have here:Okay, so I skipped over professional wrestling.Still, though, some of the very people in the cameos where Donald Trump can be found are the celebrities who are dead set against the idea of his candidacy, and who will tell the world and any one else who will listen what a horrid man he is, and that they will be leaving the United States if he is elected.Uh-huh.For decades Donald Trump has been in the public eye and never before ? not even when he was mingling with anyone who is anyone in Hollywood ? have complaints against him been raised as they have in the last few weeks. ?The accusations are beyond transparent, and are wearing very thin.Donald Trump gave a face to a movement that began years ago when the American people were betrayed by our leadership, and anti-American taxes and legislation were passed by Congress. ?All along the way, we?ve been gaslighted and lied to by the mainstream media as well. ?We get that. ?The people in the swamp in Washington, D.C., do not want to admit that we know this. ?Now is our time to make a statement that cannot be ignored.',fake

'A homeless woman who could have mental issues, but demonstrated quite a bit of bravery anyway, parked herself over Donald Trump?s star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame earlier this week after vandals took to it with a sledge hammer. ?Images of her protecting the star went viral. ?And then, just like the people who feel free to destroy property are wont to do in this election season, this happened:As of Friday evening, Michael Cohen, an Executive Vice President and Special Counsel to Donald Trump, put word out on Twitter, specifically appealing to Diamond and Silk for help, that Trump himself was looking for the woman. ?He has something for her.Subsequent tweets implore anyone who finds the woman to contact him directly, not via the campaign. As Gateway Pundit points out, that means for Donald Trump, this is personal. The conversation went into the night with Mr. Cohen and the twitter community. There are people in Hollywood looking for the woman for Trump, and sooner or later she will be found.The reality is, though, that this incident is a microcosm of this election. Most Americans in liberal outposts ? like the one where this writer lives ? are afraid to actually publicly endorse Trump as a candidate. Lawn signs are stolen and burned. Cars get keyed or spray painted. Trump?s star got smashed. The opposition has no qualms anymore of respecting property, either public or private.And then to attack a woman, homeless or not, for expressing her thoughts ? and the reality that with tens of millions of people living on the streets, even the homeless have competition from illegals ? is plain and simply unAmerican. Whoever that woman is, and what ever her story is, she is still a human being and does not deserve to be beaten for saying things the Hillary cult doesn?t want to hear.',fake
'It?s really easy to get depressed in America these days. ?After close to thirty years of destructive globalist policies taking hold in the government, our country is a mess. ?Economically, the working middle class has been all but destroyed. ?Jobs have left the country and have moved to places with lower corporate taxes and minimal environmental standards. ?Junk is imported from overseas at dirt cheap prices thanks to what amounts to no tariff. ?We are awash in debt at every level of society and government. ?And to add insult to injury, the echo chamber that is the bought and paid for mainstream media is running victory laps for the presidential candidate who represents the people who did this to us ? before the election. ?(Yes, it?s a deliberate attempt to demoralize the Trump train.)Honestly, it?s not an easy time to be an American. ?Those of us who support the candidate who best represents traditional American-style capitalism are targets for vandalism and hatred by those who oppose him. ?Those who oppose the man are caught in endless echo chambers of ?journalists? who have set themselves up as ?experts? in a culture that surrendered critical thinking to them. ?There is no escaping the circular arguments and endless sniping with friends and family who will quit one?s presence at the first provocation.Honestly, this country is a wasteland of nothing but fruitless arguments and ?educated? useful idiots demonstrating the definition of insanity. ?Other people in the world have seen this situation before. ?They live in the lands that our ancestors left behind, and many of them are right with us in the fight against globalism and ?leaders? who have anything but the best interests of their people at heart. ?They are in the same place we are without free speech and largely without the right to bear arms.One man, the leader of the People?s Party of Belgium, is fighting the same fight as Americans against globalism. ?In one way, his fight is ours and ours is his. ?This is his latest message to the people of America.This is a reminder to go to the polls and vote against globalism no matter what the mainstream media has to say. ?Our Waterloo awaits.',fake

'Paul Ryan is a despicable traitor to our nation, the Republican Party and to the American people. He is a fraud, at best one possessing the integrity of Judas Iscariot, though that is arguably a standard he falls well short of. ?He is an employee of those working to destroy this nation for their own materialistic enrichment and expansion of power. He works for the same people Hillary Clinton is working for and towards the same destructive, anti-American objectives. He is a tool of the globalists who never supported Donald Trump.We all witnessed the contortions Weasel Ryan went through during the primary in his attempt to position himself as the alternative to Donald Trump during a brokered convention. He was one of the team of puppets that included John Kasich, Mitt Romney and Calgary Ted Cruz who were acting to subvert the system, who talk party unity while working against it, ready to be inserted by the power brokers once they were able to orchestrate an opening.The ambush bus video release and whatever else may yet be unveiled by the filthy shadow government puppeteers was designed to be the crack through which a successful revolt was engineered and one of these puppets, owned by the enemy of a free and prosperous America, would be?placed into power. It would be a return to the normal politics of late, a slow circling of the drain as America is stripped of our wealth and identity. We would once again be given the mirage of a choice rather than the freedom to choose.But it didn?t work and now the sleazy little rodent, Paul Ryan, is left further exposed for what he is. He, like his fellow traitor and globalist tool, Senator Mike Lee, tried to create momentum for Americans to turn our backs on our future, on our children and on our nation, and to surrender to their power play. It?s the hand their masters gave them to play although they are not victims. Ryan, Lee and his ilk are opportunists setting themselves up for the devil?s rewards.Having failed in his effort to pull the rug out from under Mr. Trump by his impressive debate performance and the wake of a Hillary Clinton meltdown under the heat of a spotlight of Trump directed scrutiny, the traitor, Weasel Ryan, now has publicly once again taken the position that he has always truly held. He won?t support Mr. Trump. The reality is he never has; he?s just going through a cycle in which he?s not trying quite so hard to pretend that he?s not a turncoat.In a Monday morning conference call the establishment shill, who was placed into power by the Chamber of Commerce and other global fascist interests over the objections of those who knew what we were getting, made it official.? The New York Times reports that Weasel Ryan informed those on the call ?that he would never again campaign alongside Mr. Trump and would dedicate himself instead to defending the party?s majority in Congress, according to five lawmakers who participated in the call and spoke on condition of anonymity.?Ryan is attempting to save face following his failed coup and to pick up the pieces that he and his establishment anti-Trump operatives have created as they work to destroy the Republican Party and devolve the American political system into what it effectively is already, a one party system under the boot of the establishment oligarchs. They?ll all call themselves Democrats one day soon, at a point when it?s already a foregone conclusion and irreversible by their estimation.By then the globalist invasion of America by the Mexicans, Central Americans and Islamists will be complete and our country will exist in name only. Ryan?s current charade, along with Mr. Lee and Mitt Romney, is the likely outgrowth of the ?Romney Summit? back in June in Park City Utah.None of these globalist traitors ever intended to support Mr. Trump or gives a damn about party unity or the future of our nation beyond what?s in it for them and their puppeteers. That truth is becoming painfully obvious. The solution is a little more elusive but it still begins with one important and critical event. The election of Donald J.

'WH Spokesliar: Obama doesn?t think we?re entitled to answers or the truth, our non-elite little peasant minds couldn?t handle it. We?re deplorable rednecks and as such he must be very careful in dispensing what we?re allowed to believe. We also shouldn?t trust what we hear with our ears or see with our lying eyes. Obama and Clinton will provide our proper programming at the appropriate time; they?ll tell us what to believe.Obama?s spokesliar and information filter, Josh Earnest, warned the fragile and impressionable American people not to accept the truth about the regime?s voter fraud and racketeering that was revealed in the Project Veritas videos. He said they should be taken ?not just with a grain of salt but maybe even a whole package of salt.? Wow, they must be just packed with lies; please show us where they are Mr. Earnest and thank you for protecting us.Earnest is in a tough spot. He can?t dispute the indisputable evidence, the admissions of criminal election fraud and mob tactics being used against Americans supporting Donald Trump. He did what Democrats often do when the news is damaging or unpleasant, he attacked the messenger. Earnest said, ?Despite what the name might suggest, these videos have not often revealed the truth.?So we are apparently to believe that the two goons forced out by the revelations, their own admissions on hidden video, quit because they were exposed as liars? If that were a cause for firing Democrats, Mr. Trump would be running unopposed. They were forced out because they?ve been caught committing some very serious crimes and implicated the entire Democrat Party machinery. That includes the current criminal candidate, Hillary Clinton, as well as the occupier of the White House, Hussein Obama.One of the goons who was engaged in voter system racketeering, Bob Creamer, visited the White House 342 times over the period of time it has been befouled by Obama?s presence. Are we to assume they were also just talking about Bill Clinton?s golf game and grandkids? Creamer admitted he was inciting violence and committing fraud in the videos. Could that have been at the direction of the community organizing radical sitting with his feet propped up on the people?s Oval Office desk?Earnest didn?t want to comment on the video specifics, which is understandable since he might have to get into details that would implicate the White House and Clinton, but said the idea of initiating or provoking confrontations and violence at an opponent?s campaign is contrary to the Obama community organizing methodology. It?s too bad it never occurred to him to mention his strong morality convictions to the ?head thug? during one of those 342 visits.Earnest said, ?We shouldn?t have to resort to violence and in fact it is completely inappropriate to resort to violence to advance a political goal.? Earnest called it a principle that ?president? Obama ?strongly believed in.? What Obama strongly believes in is using every means possible, as Alinsky taught him, ?the end justifies the means,? as long as he doesn?t get caught, Josh. That?s his principle that was violated.Earnest encouraged those who view the videos to exercise, ?extreme caution,? saying, ?Time and time and time again, the information that was released by this organization was a lot different than initial reports would indicate.? Was there a denial in there, Earnest? Surely he?s going to provide us with a sampling from all of those inaccurate reports.In what was a de facto admission that he doesn?t have a lie that will make the problem of a direct connection between the two thugs and Obama go away, Earnest dodged a question about why Creamer had visited the White House 342 times and met with Obama 47 times.He was asked to explain the nature of the relationship between the two Democrat criminals, Obama and Creamer. He replied, ?I?m not sure that I can describe it, because, I?m not sure there is much of one.? If you meet with someone 47 times, you have a relationship although it may be shady, criminal and conspiratorial, it?s still a relationship. Josh doesn?t describe it because saying nothing is the best cover up and he?ll use it for as long as the friendly press will let him get away with it.Please like Rick?on Facebook at?https://www.facebook.com/RickRWells/?and at?Stop The Takeover,?https://www.facebook.com/StopTheTakeover/?and please follow on Twitter?@RickRWells?I?d also appreciate it if you SUBSCRIBE in the right sidebar on my website at?http://RickWells.us.',fake
'Now that we?re there and the American public is FINALLY voting, we are starting to see exit polls pop up as conducted by media outlets. ?One such poll, Morning Consult/Politico, was released early on election day and was conducted among early voters starting October 18. ?Among the 6,782 people polled, their hearts? desire was not a great economy, or a candidate that shared their values. ?Nope. ?It was more simple than that.Imagine that. ?After eight years of a metrosexual in the White House who made one mess on the International Stage after another whether the media reported it that way or not, the American people want a strong leader. ?Go figure.Asked what characteristic is most important for the next president, 36 percent of voters say they want a ?strong leader,? 29 percent want ?a vision for the future,? 16 percent want someone who ?cares about people like me? and another 16 percent said they want someone who ?shares my values.?The percentage of voters thus far who say they want a strong leader ? a characterization Donald Trump?s team made central to his campaign ? is twice the percentage who said they were looking for a strong leader in the 2012 National Election Pool exit poll.Okay, the readers say, we get it. ?Americans want a strong leader. ?What?s the big deal? ?Well, the big deal is the rest of the touchy feely questions asked of the voters. ?(Are all of these media polling sorts stuck in PMS mode?)Yes, the people are angry. ?This particular question was couched in the context of how one feels about the negative vibes during the course of the campaign (something that was being fed incessantly by the mainstream media itself), but not in terms of what has been done to the country as a whole by the government in the last few decades.No, that concept, how do the people feel about their economic and living situations this election year, is expressed thusly.And no one seemed to think it significant that the MOST telling stat ? that fewer people polled said that their situation was BETTER today than four years ago ? was the one worth touting.Voters are less enthusiastic about the country?s financial situation. More than four in 10 (44 percent) said the country?s finances are worse off today than four years ago, compared with one-third who said it?s better and one-fifth (21 percent) who said it hasn?t changed much.Again, Republicans?(71 percent of whom say the country is worse off)?were much more likely to take a negative view of the country?s finances than Democrats, 22 percent of whom said the same. Only a quarter (22 percent) of independents think the country?s finances are in better shape, while almost half (48 percent) said the U.S. was worse off.Note that the individual is ignored here. ?Just the mood of the country is explained.But still, the idea of Americans wanting a strong leader was a shock to the people conducting the poll. After decades of masculinity attacked in the news and entertainment media, it is refreshing to see.',fake
'In a true case of journalism is the rough draft of history?.On Sunday, a ?state sponsor? or ?state actor? hacked into the Wikileaks apparatus and cut off access from the boss to his people. ?This, apparently, triggered some sort of command for a ?dead man?s switch? or code or, according to Gizmodo, file hashes, to be used in such an event which was broadcast to the world via Twitter. ?For people sophisticated enough in matters of code and internet speak, the links were recognized for what they were: proof that the original email files were not tampered with, and what to watch for when the email drops actually happen.?Pre-commitment? in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes.?There were three codes given with three different subject matters:AGAIN: THE FILE HASH WILL CHANGE IF THE FILES ARE TAMPERED WITH.Naturally, given the state of heightened paranoia about Assange who is hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London because he?s a wanted man in almost every other western country, this was interpreted as him being dead. ?After all, the rumor, thanks to emails posted online by Wikileaks from various Clinton machine staffers, is that Hillary would like to see him droned.What didn?t help, was the immediate online dialog of ?worst case scenarios? and rumors on Reddit feeds that claimed there was all sorts of police at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to seize the man which turned out not to be true. ?Those rumors are persisting, though, with some even saying that United Kingdom is taking back the land, and has arrested Assange. ?With no live footage of this, there is no way to know for sure from the western side of the pond. ?However, one Reddit user on this thread insisted that he did witness some police activity that subsided after a short amount of time.You?d think given the amount of grief almost every western nation has been given by this man, if he was captured or killed it would be at the top of every news cast. ?Word is that there is D-Notice in place in jolly old England, meaning the media cannot report on the incident if it happened. ?That is not confirmed beyond commenters on online boards. Also not confirmed, is that a Wikileaks volunteer has visited Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy and has proof of life.What IS perfectly clear from the information known to the public is that Assange and Wikileaks are slowly dribbling out very damaging information hacked, and subsequently ?stolen? from Clinton operative John Podesta?s gmail account. ?They claim they are saving the best for last, and there is no reason not to believe them given some of the bombshells we?ve seen so far. ?With a regime operating inside the?United States?that seems to stop at nothing to be sure their plans are carried out ? Clinton Body Count, anyone ? finding a way to neutralize Assange in the cards is not implausible.What is NOT perfectly clear, is what ?state actor? or ?state party? did the severing. ?The U.S. government, and the Clinton machine have been blaming the Russian government for all of the leaking, claiming that Wikileaks is a front for Russian intelligence. ?Assange has denied this, and various bloggers who know about bouncing signals off of internet gateways claim that hacking originates elsewhere. ?As of this writing, no specific ?state party? has been named as the guilty entity.At this point, all we can do is sit and wait for the next shoe to drop. ?With the dead man?s switch activated and the code or file hash sent to whoever is next in the chain, Wikileaks and the bombshells will go on. ?It?s not like the brainiacs in Assange?s stable didn?t plan for something like this coming.',fake
'Contrary to popular belief that social media and messaging apps have had only negative impact on society and are cause behind growing number of divorces in India, Whatsapp, the revolutionary messaging service on mobiles, may have had a major social impact in India, according to a new survey. But how?Earlier, wives would often call their husbands in the office several times during the day, and the phone would often go ringing. The husband would say later he was busy. But many times, wives suspected if he was lying. Their over-imaginative minds would lead them to think their husbands were having a affair in the office, hence unable to take her call. The result ? the wife would eventually file for divorce, and the marriage would break. The same happened the other way too, as husbands calling wives who worked in office, often felt suspicious if the wife did not pick up the phone and later said she was busy.However, Whatsapp messaging has helped the communication between husbands and wives, by making it very convenient and trackable. It is convenient because the person can type a quick reply even if he or she is busy in a meeting. The lack of communication for being unable to take a call, is now replaced with a convenient communication flow on whatsapp. Secondly, it is trackable because the sender can see when the recipient was last online on whatsapp and if he or she has read the message. So only if there is a gap in their reply despite the recipient being online can the sender suspect, else in other cases they will not. At least it reduces the number of suspect cases, whereas earlier it was occuring almost every time.',fake
'Ever wonder why you aren?t seeing any pro-Trump advertising from the Republican National Committee on television? ?The answer is very simple. ?There isn?t any. ?And there isn?t any because the RNC made the decision to focus their efforts ?downstream? claiming that television advertising is a waste of money, they are investing in the ground game, and asking the better positioned campaigns and Super-PACs to make the effort. ?From Politico:In 2004, the committee spent $18.2 million on independent expenditures ? or IEs, in campaign parlance ? boosting George W. Bush?s reelection bid. In 2008, the RNC?s IE spending surged to $53.5 million in support of John McCain?s campaign against Barack Obama. And in 2012, the RNC spent $42.4 million on IEs boosting Mitt Romney or opposing President Obama ? with nearly 80 percent of the spending occurring before mid-October.By contrast, this cycle the RNC has spent only $321,000 on independent expenditures attacking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And all of that spending occurred last fall ? before Trump had emerged as the leader for the GOP presidential nomination.This has some pro-Trump Republicans working for the Super-PACs and in other capacities a little riled.?The Democrats have an unprecedented and lopsided advertising advantage in this race like we have never seen before, and it is having a serious and negative effect,? said Curt Anderson, a former RNC political director who is helping a pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now. ?It is possible that Trump has sealed his fate at this point, but it is still a terrible mistake not to have $50 million of advertising from the Republican Party exposing Hillary Clinton and keeping her numbers down,? said Anderson, who helped to lead the RNC?s independent expenditure effort in 2004 and 2008.Given the desperateness of the Clinton campaign tactics this week, and the reality that Trump is now up in the RIGGED polls, let alone the honest ones, that advantage might not be for much, but the end result remains to be seen.However, the people at the RNC have a point: the groups with the unlimited dollars are better positioned to spend on television advertising since the rates are lower for them. ?That does not change the poor optics for the party itself when the supporting cast downstream started jumping off the presidential candidate?s ship with the first story that challenged the supposedly tenuous hold he has on women voters. ?(Most of us aren?t so immature as to fall for obvious political sabotage.)So, now we know. ?The Republican National Committee is really letting Trump run on his own. ?Way to rally behind the candidate.',fake

But you and the ?president? didn?t because you couldn?t face the political humiliation of putting boots back on the ground in Iraq after you took credit for pulling them out.

His mother had died prior to his sister?s death before September, ?17 as the reports said. That prince was descendant of Awadh Nawab Wajid Ali Shah whose razzle-dazzle can never be overlooked.It was quite strange that a progeny of that opulent Nawab was living in a pitiable condition. He used to ask people for food and one person of the locality would feed him. He would wander near the forests in Chankyapuri. A distant relative from Aligarh would visit him every few years. Some descendants of the Nawab was said to have been lived in Matiya Burj of Kolkata but their relationship with the prince did not seem to stand. Nawab did find mention more often but his progenies are forgotten in the wilderness? Likewise, we hear of the descendants of Tipu Sultan living in penury while the king is much in the news these days. Similar stories were heard about the Mughal descendants whose ancestors lived royal lives. The regal families? fall is so scary as to compel them to such an extent. Were their privy purses not stopped, they would have lived a normal life?',fake
'Bengaluru: Bengaluru based techie Pradeep is struggling to link Aadhaar with ?items? government has already enforced like PAN, Provident Fund, Mobile SIM card etc. To make his life even measurable new new items are getting added every other day like the need to link Aadhaar with driving license.This is not the only problem Pradeep has in his hands, His wife Ramola has started doubting on his ?character?. ?A techie like him who goes to office for 18 hours daily, he will spend his Saturdays in running around to link his Aadhaar. Kuch to gadbad hai,? said Ramola.?I am the creator of my problems. Was mad when I opened so many bank accounts needlessly just by looking at the freebies they offered like movie tickets, Pizza coupons etc. Gone to SBI some four times, whenever I went there the concerned person is always out like he has gone for breakfast, tea or lunch.?Pradeep added, ?PAN and Aadhaar ka link to mat bolo. Online it said your name does not match with records. First I ran towards Income tax office for PAN correction where they asked for Aadhaar with correct name and when I went to Aadhaar office they asked for PAN with correct name. Kuch hua to nahin, mera bata chapal hi ghis gaya, now I am using liberty?.Pradeep said, ?Now Ramola does not know about all these. She does not know I have some sixteen sim cards with different service providers in my name, some I have bought for her and her family members in my name as they did not have ID proofs. If my mobile or her mobile gets locked, she will doubt on me more, kuch to galat kar raha hai yeh banda.?Pradeep said, ?Private banks are no good either. They gave me coffee and linked my Aadhaar with account. But every day more than ten calls I am getting from them, sir take this loan, take this credit card from us, so many exciting offers exclusively for you.?Pradeep is now looking to run away to some other country before Govt. stops him by bringing Aadhaar equation in doing so.',fake
'A WikiLeaks email that was part of the most recent batch from Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta includes information that indicates that while Clinton and her aide Cheryl Mills claim to be too lame-brained to understand the significance of a ?C? designation on classified emails, they?re not too dense to realize that documenting the fact that Hussein Obama knew all about her illegal email account and gave at a minimum tacit approval is not such a great idea. Not for those residing on the criminal side of the equation, anyway.\r\nIn an email chain that surfaced, much of the entire Clinton leadership team is seen scrambling to hide the documentation that would prove what we all already know, that Obama is a pathological liar. In this case it is proven by virtue of the his correspondence with Hillary Clinton on her illegal server.\r\n\r\nThe conflict arises from a statement by Obama that, as was so often the story the ?out of the loop? Obama used, he just learned of Hillary Clinton?s use of a personal email server and account to conduct State Department business on the television news.\r\nThe message was an alert from the same Clinton insider who was videotaped feeding propagandist Andrea Mitchell a question on the Clinton plane following the third debate, Nick Merrill. He?s informing Jen Palmieri, the Clinton communications director, that Obama is busted if any of those emails surface.\r\nCampaign boss, Podesta gave orders, ?We need to clean this up.? That?s Democrat or Clinton speak meaning it?s time to engage in their standard operating procedure of obstruction, obfuscation and cover up. Clearly the entire group is composed of liars covering for other liars, committing various acts of treason and exploitation against the American people and the United States along the way.

'Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans?still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. He?s since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white-hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer.\r\nThere were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obama?s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti-white, anti-American prejudice.\r\n\r\nAs the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. That?s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ ?Civil Rights? Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non-white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just ?who we are? under this racist America-hating Islamist.\r\nOne thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race-based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasn?t enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included.\r\n\r\nShe also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission; what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits?\r\nThe WikiLeaks Podesta email from October of 2008, forwarded to John Podesta, which contains the Bansal correspondence is linked here and below:\r\nFwd: FW: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates\r\n?\r\nFrom:[email?protected]\r\nTo: [email?protected]\r\nDate: 2008-10-17 08:18\r\nSubject: Fwd: FW: Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates\r\nLists from Preeta attached.

A couple things to note about the listof Muslim American candidates:?1) In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some ArabAmerican background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). ManyLebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (ofoutside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be MuslimAmerican, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but ofuncertain religion (esp. Christian).?2) There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for aSecretary-level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists,there are some very senior people listed in the last category (for outsideboards/commissions) who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. Thevery senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terriblyinvolved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans,had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so Ithought we should seek new talent. But there?s no magic to some of theplacements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of thepeople may be moved to other categories.?3) High-profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amountof blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to beESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list wouldnot survive such a vet ? but I do personally know, at least in part,virtually all of the candidates in the 1st two categories (but I know veryfew of those listed for outside boards/commissions).?4) I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the endof the second category, but for various reasons, I didn?t think any ofthem would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment.Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluatethem further.?DOJ list will be coming in the next two days.

'It finally happened. A true, honest to goodness easy to understand smoking gun popped up in one of the WikiLeaks John Podesta email caches. ?This one came in WikiLeaks drop number 25, but here it is.It just so happens that the date of the email above was March 2, 2015 ? the same day that the New York Times published a story titled, ?Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Department, Possibly Breaking Rules.? ?Imagine that. ?What this means could be anyone?s guess, but the reality is that when questioned about ?intent? and the destruction of emails that would prove either that Barack Obama and company knew Hillary Clinton was using a personal email or that all of those emails that were destroyed by BleachBit were part of some cover up. ?That at least points to intent, if not proves it. ?Remember, lack of intent is what is being used as the excuse to NOT prosecute Hillary Clinton for any of her crimes.What is also intriguing in this exchange, and one adjacent to it in the full universe of Podesta emails, is the mention of ?Lanny.? It is suggested that ?Lanny? is Lanny Davis, Bill Clinton?s personal counsel. ?From Zero Hedge:Furthermore, a search for Lanny Davis reveals the following curious exchange between Robby Mook and John Podesta from March 8, 2015, just days after the above mentioned exchange, in which Mook saysIt seems the Clinton campaign was not happy with being set on a course of transparency by Bill Clinton?s special counsel.That would be an understatement if the purpose of getting rid of the emails was to cover up their existence. As it was at the time, the White House press people were busy not denying any of this happening.Is this enough to put the final torpedo in the hull of the SS Hillary? ?Maybe not.

'WikiLeaks Clinton Goldman Sachs Speeches ? Golden Years As Wall St SenatorHillary Clinton?s version of confession is when she goes before Goldman Sachs or their fat cat equivalent and actually tells something resembling the truth. We thought she didn?t have it in her because, as members of the public and the American people that she so loathes, it?s something we haven?t previously been exposed to.The latest WikiLeaks release from Friday included an email from Clinton Campaign Research Director Tony Carrk, dated 01/23/2016 with the subject of Goldman Sachs paid speeches. The email was a collection of portions of three speeches Clinton gave to her financiers at Goldman Sachs. Below are two excerpts from a speech on October 24th, 2013.Clinton said, ?And with political people, again, I would say the same thing, you know, there was a lot of complaining about Dodd-Frank, but there was also a need to do something because for political reasons, if you were an elected member of Congress and people in your constituency were losing jobs and shutting businesses and everybody in the press is saying it?s all the fault of Wall Street, you can?t sit idly by and do nothing, but what you do is really important.? [GS2, 10/24/13]Clinton said, ?I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it, but I do ? I think that when we talk about the regulators and the politicians, the economic consequences of bad decisions back in ?08, you know, were devastating, and they had repercussions throughout the world.?

'Americans can be forgiven for believing that WikiLeaks was a complete creation of Julian Assange. ?In fact, it was not. ?It was directed, at least,?by Assange?s mentor, Gavin MacFadyen, a resident of the Pimlico District of London. ?Mr. MacFadyen died on Saturday, October 22, 2016 in London. ?He was 76.In the hours following his death, multiple tweets from Wikileaks expressed sadness at the man?s passing as well as accolades for his mentoring and journalistic integrity.The CIJ team also published an address from MacFadyen?s wife and member of Julian Assange?s Defense Fund, Susan Benn, who described her husband as a ?larger-than-life person,? with gratitude and respect.?He was the model of what a journalist should be? He spearheaded the creation of a journalistic landscape which has irrevocably lifted the bar for ethical and hard-hitting reporting. Gavin worked tirelessly to hold power to account.?His life and how he lived it were completely in sync with the principles that he held dear and practiced as a journalist and educator ? to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,? Benn wrote.MacFadyen was the producer and director of more than 50 investigative journalism films. ?He also was banned in his lifetime by the Soviet Union and South Africa?s apartheid.In his professional career, MacFadyen shed light on topics like child labor, pollution, the torture of political prisoners, neo-Nazis in Britain, UK industrial accidents, Contra murders in Nicaragua, the CIA, maritime piracy, election fraud in South America, South African mines, as well as many others. He worked on investigative television programs for PBS?s Frontline, Granada Television?s World in Action, the BBC?s Fine Cut, Panorama, The Money Programme, and 24 Hours, as well as Channel 4?s Dispatches.At this writing, MacFadyen?s cause of death is unknown. His wife posted a short-lived tweet saying that he passed away after a short illness. ?That has been scrubbed from the online world. ?Other writers have put forth information that better fits the suspicious timing of Mr. MacFadyen?s death.By the way, Batch #18 of the Podesta emails was released by WikiLeaks today.',fake
'The tactic of branding Donald Trump?s openness to dealing with Putin and his lack of prejudicial animosity for the Russians is seen as a weakness to be exploited by the Clinton warmongers in their efforts to distort who Donald Trump is and to discredit him by creating a relationship that doesn?t exist between him and Putin while masking their own web of entanglements.They also recognized the actual vulnerability of Hillary Clinton in her joint?responsibility?for the growth of ISIS and failures of her shared ?strategy? with Hussein Obama for dealing with them.In one of the Podesta emails released by WikiLeaks, the following comments were made by political advisor Brent Budowsky to Podesta. It?s advice that an examination of the rhetoric indicates was acted upon by the Clinton campaign. He recommended:????be careful about the U.N., support but don?t go too far. Putin did not agree to anything about removing Assad and continues to bomb the people we support. [Rebels, ISIS, Al-Nusra] We pushed the same position in 2012 (Geneva 1, which HRC knows all about) and Geneva 2 in 2014. Odds that Putin agrees to remove Assad are only slightly better than the odds the College of Cardinals chooses me to someday succeed Pope Francis.?Best approach is to slaughter Donald for his bromance with Putin, but not go too far betting on Putin re Syria.??Does she really want to co-own the Obama-Clinton ISIS strategy?? She will never state what I believe we need to do?at least 20,000 ground troops with 3,000 American and at least 10,000 from Sunni Muslim nations? because she is consumed with keeping Obama?s goodwill and afraid of liberal backlash.? But at the least she should not be branding and infecting herself with Obama?s policy towards Syria and ISIS by offering such high and direct praise for it.?She does NOT want to run for Obama?s third term on ISIS and Syria to continue the Obama-Clinton policy against ISISThe best single move to elect her would be a massive voter registration and organization drive. Expand the electorate so more voters will vote so her low trust ratings generally will have less prorated impact, and the number of higher trust voters will be newly registered.There is no ad on earth that will increase her trust ratings or the enthusiasm of her voters the way a mega-registration project will increase her support on election day.? As for ISIS, the mathematically worst place for her to be is co-owner of the Obama-Clinton policy. Obama could destroy her candidacy the same way Democrats lost control of the House, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures during her presidency.?

'Wikileaks, how did we ever have presidential campaigns without you? ?On Monday, October 31, after one too many emails from Democratic National Committee?s acting chairwoman, Donna Brazile,?sharing debate questions and information came to light via the John Podesta gmail cache, CNN took a machete to her suspended contract. Politico broke the story:CNN says it is ?completely uncomfortable? with hacked emails showing former contributor and interim DNC chair Donna Brazile sharing questions with the Clinton campaign before a debate and a town hall during the Democratic primary, and has accepted her resignation.Hacked emails posted by WikiLeaks show Brazile, whose CNN contract was suspended when she became interim DNC chair over the summer, sharing with the Clinton campaign a question that would be posed to Hillary Clinton before the March CNN Democratic debate in Flint, and sharing with the campaign a possible question prior to a CNN town hall also in March.In a statement, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said that on Oct. 14, the network accepted Brazile?s resignation.?On October 14th, CNN accepted Donna Brazile?s resignation as a CNN contributor. (Her deal had previously been suspended in July when she became the interim head of the DNC.) CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate. We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor,? Pratapas said.The dates do invite confusion as this formal separation was announced seventeen days AFTER the resignation was accepted, and the email leaks are listed as the reason for the final cords being cut. ?Any number of scenarios could have been discussed, but it looks like the impropriety ? and getting caught ? was just too much for CNN.Donna Brazile, for her part, thanked the people of CNN for their collegiality during her tenure there.Can?t you, the reader, just hear what this woman has to say?',fake
'WikiLeaks : While the specific numbers vary between polls and the way the question is asked, most Americans want more, not less enforcement of our immigration laws and borders, with a majority wanting less immigration of any kind, legal or illegal. According to the Pew Research Center, 83\% of Americans want levels frozen where they are or reduced.Hillary Clinton couldn?t care less. She represents an extension and a compounding of the current abuse of power, in service to the special interests that are working to destroy our nation. One of those she serves in that regard is Goldman Sachs. She attempted to hide her speeches to that infamous banking institution, knowing full well that she was violating the wishes of the American people. As is often the case, Clinton failed, WikiLeaks got their hands on them and on Friday, released them to the world. They vividly illustrate just how little regard she has for the American people.In pressing for open borders, or ?immigration reform? as it is referenced in Democrat code speak, She told executives at Goldman Sachs that Americans who want to limit immigration are ?fundamentally un-American? in a speech given three years ago, in October of 2013.She said, ?Immigration reform is so important,? as she demanded that Congress ?get immigration reform done.? In this context she was referring to the gang of eight legislation of open borders RINOs McCain, Flake, Rubio and Graham.As noted by Breitbart, provisions of that bill included immediate amnesty and eventual citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, a doubling of the annual admission of foreign workers, and the dispensation of 33 million green cards to foreign nationals in the span of a single decade despite current record immigration levels. That figure alone represents a ten percent jump in the population of the United States.WikiLeaks revealed that Clinton thinks we patriots are not only deplorable and unredeemable, in Clinton?s increasingly bugged-out eyes, we?re obstructionists as well. She told the gathered bankers, ?What I really resent most about the obstructionists is they have such a narrow view of America. They see America in a way that is no longer reflective of the reality of who we are. They?re against immigration for reasons that have to do with the past, not the future. They can?t figure out how to invest in the future, so they cut everything. You know, laying off, you know, young researchers, closing labs instead of saying, we?re better at this than anybody in the world, that?s where our money should go. They just have a backward-looking view of America. And they play on people?s fears, not on people?s hopes, and they have to be rejected. I don?t care what they call themselves. I don?t care where they?re from. They have to be rejected because they are fundamentally un-American.?She went on to further cheapen and demean our American citizenship and heritage, saying that we?re just an idea that anyone can have, that being ?American? is not a national identity, but rather is ?an intellectual invention.?She distorted the very definition of citizenship, saying, ?American was an invention. It was an intellectual invention, and we have done pretty well for all these years. And these people want to just undermine that very profound sense of who we are. And we can?t let them do that. So it?s not just about politics or partisanship. It really goes to the heart of what it means to be American.?Maybe whatever destructive forces first led her to develop her liberal enlightened intellectualism have finally completely eaten away the remnants of her brain. America is not an intellectual invention anymore than Canada, Australia, Germany, Great Britain or even China or Russia are. We?re a nation. She?s attempting to smooth-talk her treachery to a point that isn?t a direct assault on our Constitution and treasonous. Failure awaits her at every turn.America is us, it?s our nation, it?s who we are. We do not exist for the pleasure or enrichment either the elite parasites within or their counterparts among the invading rabble.

'Wikileaks: The Clinton campaign keeps telling the American people that Vladimir Putin wants Trump elected, and that he?s put his ?Russian hackers? to work trying to sabotage Clinton on his behalf. The phantom operatives are as hard to find as evidence of global warming and the false claims that they are responsible are just as ?certain.? They?re the ones who broke into the private systems, Clinton tells us it was they who revealed the Democrat?s serious misdeeds, statements and crimes to the public.Of course that line of thinking completely discounts the conflict of interest and complicity of the Clinton?s in the Uranium One deal in which they earned over $160 million for selling Russia rights to much of America?s?Uranium production. It is also completely inconsistent with new information that was just released by WikiLeaks as part of Hillary Clinton?s Campaign Chairman John Podesta?s emails, the fact that he is on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, ?which received million from a Putin-connected Russian government fund.?Podesta also received 75,000 common shares of stock.? Trump has sworn that he has no business relationship with Mr. Putin or with Russia beyond one year that they hosted his beauty pageant. Obviously that is a statement that Mr. Podesta cannot make, or at least, not truthfully. It would appear that the Democrats are once again projecting their misdeeds onto their opponents as a diversion.The newly released email by Wikileaks is in the form of a forwarded message titled ?Podesta Outstanding Docs for Joule.? Eryn Sepp, an assistant to Podesta at the Center for American Progress, forwarded it to Podesta from ?Mark C. Solakian, a Senior Vice President and General Counsel at Joule Unlimited Technologies, Inc.It was otherwise a mundane bit of housekeeping, aside from the Russian connection now exposed. Slovakian wrote in the 2014 mailing, ?It is my understanding that John transferred the resulting 75,000 common shares from the option exercise to the Leonidio LLC. As such, we would need to edit the Transfer of Share Agreement to reflect the transfer of 75,000 common shares to the LLC.?Donald Trump Senior Communications Advisor Jason Miller weighed in on the report, saying, ?The disclosure that Clinton Chair John Podesta transferred his shares in Putin-backed Joule Unlimited to an anonymous holding company when he joined the Obama Administration is extremely concerning.?Because the holding company is completely anonymous, we do not know whether or not he still has deep financial ties to Vladimir Putin and his regime.? Miller added, ?As such, Mr. Podesta needs to either reveal who is behind the holding company or he must resign from the Clinton campaign immediately.?Podesta was required by law to fully disclose his position on the Joule Unlimited board of directors and to make it part of his federal financial disclosures before taking his position as Hussein Obama?s senior adviser. He did not comply with those requirements which leads one to ask what else this international lobbyist and hustler is hiding from public knowledge. What about his candidate?

'Now it?s REALLY official. 2016 is the most extraordinary election year ever. Not only are the candidates an unindicted criminal and an American who has actually done something in his life, but alternative media led by the secrets publishing Wikileaks, is driving the news narratives.One of the great mysteries of it all ? where did WikiLeaks get all those emails that are so damaging to the Democrats ? has been a matter of great speculation. ?The Democrats themselves are blaming Russia. ?Many people believed that Seth Rich was a source given the way he died. ?(He may have been for all we know.) ?There is evidence that for the John Podesta stash, anyway, a phishing link sent via Georgetown University was used. ?According to one intelligence insider, none of this is accurate.Steve Pieczenik, a former colleague of Tom Clancy and writer of intricate spy novels given his background in the intelligence community now claims that the entire WikiLeaks effort was a coup of sorts to keep the Clintons out of the White House. ?It was a group effort by many patriots within the United States Government who fed information to outlets like WikiLeaks and let it be known that they were not going to allow this country to be compromised any longer.Dr. Pieczenik, a psychiatrist, explained on his blog what was behind the effort, officially known as a counter-coup since the Clintons took over the government with one through a number of side deals.As a way of counter-acting the Clinton?s silent coup of corruption, these brave men and women of the IC have released a series of emails through Julian Assange and Wiki-Leaks which underscore the Clintons? massive corruption attempts to take over our USG through the rigged electoral system.Usually, a military coup presents itself with soldiers in the street and tanks splayed out all over Washington DC and at other key communications points in the USA.This time around there was a new type of Counter-coup, an Info-Counter Coup using Wiki-leaks. Wikileaks disseminates the truth around the world, while at the same time making sure that the FBI Director, James Comey, opened up the Huma Abedin files with regards to national security violations?.You are now witnessing a new type of American Revolution. The Clintons and Podesta initiated a silent coup to undermine the USG through corruption and co-optation of the elite political leaders. In turn, they were met by the by the silent counter-coup of our civilian/military Intelligence community. In the age of the internet, brave American warriors are everywhere. They monitor any internal/external attempts to undermine this great republic.Yes. ?It looks like the FBI director succumbed to internal pressure. ?It also seems that the mysterious disappearance of Michelle Obama?s Twitter feed was part of it. ?How many other efforts by citizen journalists were part of the effort is another story.To add to his extraordinary blog post, Dr. Pieczenik put up a video on YouTube that has been picked up by Drudge and Alex Jones.If this is true, then Donald Trump?s claims that the system is rigged is an understatement. ?Dr. P is essentially saying that the election was going to be stolen, and the patriots inside the government aren?t going to let that happen. They are revealing the corruption of the Clintons for all to see.The veracity of this claim is a little fantastic to believe, but there it is. ?WikiLeaks seems to be getting information from inside the U.S. Government. ?If that thought had not crossed many a mind, it would be dismissed by now.',fake
'New Delhi:?After starting a huge political storm with one of his tweets, cricketing legend Virender Sehwag has now agreed to tweet only under adult supervision. The tweet in question has started a Twitter war that is still going strong after 4 days. From ABVP, AISA to Freedom of Expression to Indian Army to Pakistan to Haryana to literacy of sports persons, the war has covered several phases during these past 4 days.The outrage started when Sehwag tweeted this tweet, which escalated after Bollywood actor Randeep Hooda laughed at this tweet.Speaking to Faking News, Sehwag said, ?I just tweeted a joke, not a very good joke either, just like most of my jokes, but I had no idea that this will lead to?such a huge uproar. I have tweeted several PJs earlier that deserved a bigger outrage actually but I guess life is unpredictable that way. Anyway, to stay safe in future, I will only tweet when I am supervised by an adult.

They don?t get offended even if my birthday wish is a really lame poem. Still, to be on the safer side, I will be under adult supervision whenever I log on to Twitter?, Sehwag added.However, not everyone is convinced that Sehwag will listen to the person supervising him. ?He never listened to me when Iw as the coach, fat chance that he will listen to any supervisor now?, said former Indian coach Gary Kirsten.',fake

I will launch an even bigger agitation and will not stop till they add an offensive scene or two.

'Mumbai:?Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s period drama ?Padmavati? has attracted controversy ever since the film was announced by the filmmaker. Now after crossing many?hurdles, the film is set for a release on 1st of December but its problems are still not over. The film is facing the threat of a boycott in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana with Haryana minister Anil Vij calling for a ban on the film as well. In a desperate bid to get his filmr eleased without incident, Mr. Bhansali has now offered to add a scene in which Alauddin Khilji will stand for the Indian National Anthem in a bid to give a patriotic touch to the film.The film revolves around Alauddin Khilji?s attack on Chittor in a bid to get Rani Padmini who committed Jauhar along with the ladies of the Court to escape the Sultan from Delhi. The film has angered Rajput community in particular and several other communities in general. Even though Bhansali and the cast members have repeatedly said that the film will not offend anyone?s sentiments, there have been large scale protests against the film with even the politicians and royal families of Rajasthan joining in.Speaking to the media, Mr. Bhansali said ,?I have spent too much on making this film and have already paid all the actors and technicians so it is not possible for me to stop the release of the film. I can?t change the story either because if I don?t show Padmavati in Padmavati then what else will I show. Therefore, I decided to appeal to the nationalist sentiments of the people. National Anthem has become a matter of great debate over the past couple of years in the country and people are debating whether one should stand for it or not. In my film, I am ready to show Alauddin Khilji standing for the entire 52 seconds for the National Anthem when he hears it. Hopefully protesters will relent then and let me screen the film peacefully.?When asked how will he integrate National Anthem in a film based in early 14th Century, he said ,?Yaar documentary thodi banayi hai, creative freedom hai.?You leave that part to me, I will find a way to insert the National Anthem. I will even show Shahid Kapoor?s army marching to AR Rahman?s Vande Mataram.?Aur Bolo.?Karni Sena hasn?t yet responded to this offer by Mr. Bhansali but a counter protest against Mr. Bhansali is being organized this evening in JNU for forcing Khilji to stand up for the National Anthem.',fake

Nagaraj added, ?TV became a nuisance & counterproductive for us. We would be busy watching latest latka jhatka of Bollywood songs, in the meantime these animals would have happily destroyed our fields in minutes. Accidentally one day while surfing, we stopped by a channel where we saw some fifteen to twenty people creating lot of noise. All were nicely dressed, especially the man in the center with a black coat whom all will be calling Arnab, Arnab and he would be stopping them, shouting at them. We noticed when the show is running, not a single animal came near our fields, they will run away as soon as they hear the noise.??Now in last three months our life is back to square one. After beating drums through the night to scare the wild animals, we will have no energy to work next day,? said Nagaraj with a sad tone.To make Nagaraj happy, we told Arnab has already started his ?riyaz? and soon you will see him in a new channel called Republic.

'?Here is the letter in it?s entirety:Below is a picture that I have only shared with our close friends and family. It?s highly personal to Joe and I and not something I take lightly. It?s one of the only images of our sweet girl that I will have until we reach heaven. This is why I share it with you now?I wasn?t going to add to all the chatter littering my news feed about this presidential election. But after Wednesday night?s debate and moving through these last few days, desperately missing my babies that were lost either by miscarriage or stillbirth, NOT by my choosing?I can?t help but pen these words. Please hear me friends?both candidates are liars. Both are ?nasty? in their own way. Neither one lines up completely with my Christian values. Neither one hits all the issues the way I would like. I have truly *struggled* the last few months on who I was going to vote for, IF I was going to vote. With each new story that would break, each new accusation or headline, each new scandal that would surface?all of it left me disgusted and hopeless. Could this really be all we?ve got?!But then, something happened within the first few minutes of Wednesday night?s debate, and I haven?t been able to shake it. For the first time in over a year, I watched and heard Donald Trump be sympathetic, dare I say, convicted even, of what he was saying. When he said (concerning abortion), ?that?s not okay with me? and ?that?s not acceptable?, and that he would appoint Pro-Life, Supreme Court Justices?that was it. As a Christian, my choice was clear. While all of these other issues do indeed matter?nothing matters nearly as much as protecting the sanctity of human life. Not job security, not tax cuts, not education or health care, not border control or immigration laws, not inappropriate comments or deleted emails. All of it PALES in comparison to the taking of innocent, human life. I realized in that moment how selfish I had been by being SO concerned with all of the other issues. Friends, if we?re not protecting the sanctity of human life, we have NOTHING LEFT. And just so we?re clear, yes, I have been sexually assaulted by a man, and yes, I have been on the receiving end of inappropriate comments, almost my entire life. And still, my position remains the same?everything else pales in comparison to the taking of innocent, human life. As a Christian, I don?t see where there is any other choice. So, I will indeed be casting my vote on November 8th. And I will be voting for Donald Trump?if for no other reason than to protect the sanctity of human life. As a woman, as a mother, as a Christian, this is where I unapologetically stand.After 5 months of pregnancy, we lost Gabrielle without warning. I share this image with you because it could just as easily be the image of SO many other babies that Hillary Clinton thinks it?s okay to rip apart, piece by precious piece. Gabrielle was small, but even at 20 weeks, she had all ten fingers, all ten toes, she had a beautiful face with a nose, lips, eyes, and ears?she even had a cute little bum. She was loved and she was wanted. Unfortunately, she couldn?t be saved. But thousands more, just like her, can be?just not under a Clinton presidency. Hillary Clinton would probably call this post ?scare rhetoric??so be it. The idea of dismembering a human child SHOULD be scary. It should terrify us all that this kind of barbaric act is protected, even encouraged and applauded, by our United States government. It should be terrifying enough to vote Pro-Life, no matter where you stand on any other issue.Psalm 139:15-16, ?My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.

'Okay, maybe not your refrigerator, but according to the people who are gradually figuring out just what hit Dyn, one of the backbone domain name system corporations in the United States, what happened involved millions of devices sending requests to the same place at the same time.The current assault against Dyn is one of the simplest in a hacker?s playbook. The distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) doesn?t require breaking into a target?s computers or finding any secret weakness. Instead, it involves simply pummeling them with so much traffic they can?t possibly keep up. Hackers executing a DDoS call upon millions of machines under their control and command them to ask the target for so many things all at once that the target all but melts down under the strain.Those millions of machines in this case, the smart devices in the ?Internet of Things? that are connected to the larger whole, are known as ?zombies.? ?They aren?t actual computers like we think of them, but involve computerized parts and coding. ?Items like smart refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, DVRs, and on and on. ?In this specific attack, the people doing the digging to figure out what happened claim that the zombies involved are infected with a piece of malware ? malicious software ? that doesn?t interfere with the running of the device, but will start sending connection requests upon command.That, the people of the geek-o-sphere tell us, is what happened.We?re told gadgets behind tens of millions of IP addresses were press-ganged into shattering the internet ? a lot of them running the Mirai malware, the source code to which is now public so anyone can wield it against targets.The specific Mirai malware tool ? THAT ANY HACKER CAN USE SINCE THE CODE IS PUBLIC ? is called a botnet. ?And that specific botnet works with electronics weaknesses that are found EVERYWHERE.Mirai powered the largest ever DDoS attack ever, spawning a 620Gbps DDoS against KrebsOnSecurity. Source code for the malware was released on hacker forums last week.The malware relied on factory default or hard-coded usernames and passwords to compromise vulnerable IoT devices such as insecure routers, IP cameras, digital video recorders and the like.PenTestPartners, the UK security consultancy behind numerous hack on Iot devices ranging from Wi-Fi enabled kettles to cars, said that the botnet finally illustrates the consequences of IoT vendors cutting the corners on security.?We?ve said many times previously that IoT would make for the perfect botnet: Easy to compromise, hard to patch and the owner likely won?t ever have a clue that they?re part of the botnet,? PenTestPartners notes.Essentially, the smart world that we live in was used against the Internet upon which we have all come to depend. ?And the malware was sent out into the wild to prey on the smart devices that still have factory original passwords. ?Popular Mechanics has a great explanation.Designed to target the Internet of Things specifically, Mirai can scoop up connected devices and add them to a botnet simply by attempting to log into them with their factory-default username and password?The Mirai code focuses on all kinds of smart devices including cameras to internet-connected fridges, but its bread and butter is DVRs. Of the nearly 500,000 devices known to be compromised by the Mirai malware, some 80 percent of them are DVRs, according to an in-depth investigation of by Level 3 communications.So, to help keep internet attacks like the one on Friday, October 21, 2016, to a minimum, ALWAYS change factory passwords on smart devices.As of this writing, whoever gave the order to send massive amount of information at Dyn is not known. ?However, probing for weaknesses in the security measures that American internet backbone companies are using has been observed for months. ?Somebody out there is trying to gauge what it will take to cause massive disruptions. ?Friday may have been a test run to find out how fast Dyn could identify the problem and recover. ?Three separate, and distinct attacks happened during the day, and by the third, they were watching for it.This sort of interruption in internet availability is sure to continue until the public is educated to change the passwords on smart devices. ?This may not be a government induced test or hack at all. ?That doesn?t mean it?s going to stop.For a great compilation of info, go to The Register out of the U.K.',fake

'Would you prefer a heavily built man with strong muscles, financially strong men or someone who can be easily compatible with you? Your choice of partners decides whether you are a modern day feminist or someone who continue to follow the traditional values of masculinity.A new research claims that the image of a white, wealthy and muscular male still retains as an object of desire among many women.The study, published in the journal Feminist Media Studies, derived that people still desire the traditional masculine values of muscles and money in the men they find attractive and have not moved on from long-established gender roles.?They are marking the middle-class, wealthy, mobile and sexually powerful male body, not as a political one as feminists intend it to be, but one that should be actively desired. This celebration of masculine capital is achieved through humour and the knowing wink, but the outcome is a reaffirmation of men?s position in society,? said Adrienne Evans, researcher at the Coventry University in England.?It?s a problem as because although it appears as though we have moved forward, our desires are still mostly about money and strength,? Evans added.The researchers used the responses provided by the onlookers over various images of men posted on TubeCrush website, where commuters upload photographs, taken covertly, of attractive men, over a period of three years.The photographs emphasised on men?s muscular biceps, pecs and chest; the body parts which suggest physical strength and sexual prowess, along with many symbols of disposable income and wealth, such as smart suits, watches and phones.',real
'Negotiations in Mexico to update NAFTA have not made much progress on tough US demands that could sink the 1994 trade pact, but the current round of talks are progressing with civility, some participants said on Saturday.?Officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico are meeting in Mexico City for the fifth of seven planned rounds to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, from which US President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw.Time is running short to seal a deal by the deadline of end-March 2018. Officials say next year?s Mexican presidential election means talks after that date will not be possible. The US administration has made demands that the other members say are unacceptable, such as a five-year ?sunset? clause and tightening so-called rules of origin to boost the North American content of autos.?It is very slow moving but there are no fireworks,? said a Canadian source with knowledge of the talks, adding there had ?not been much conversation at all? on the more contentious US proposals.Within hours of the latest round of talks formally starting on Friday, Canada was complaining about inflexibility by the United States.Officials have so far discussed other issues such as labor, gender, intellectual property, energy and telecommunications but it is too soon to say whether there will be any breakthroughs this round, added a source familiar with the talks.?The work is moving forward,? Mexican deputy economy minister Juan Carlos Baker told reporters, adding that the three countries had prioritized technical work in Mexico City. But he said negotiators were aware that much work lay ahead and ?we have to double our efforts.??The atmosphere is good, the atmosphere is one of work,? Baker added.The mood was calmer than the tense scenes during last month?s round in Arlington, Virginia, where tough U.S. demands were revealed. Still, the negotiations have passed the halfway point of an initial schedule with few clear signs of process.Mexican officials hope chapters on telecommunications and e-commerce will be concluded by the end of business on Tuesday, but there has been no indication of this yet.Although negotiators are scheduled to discuss rules of origin every day, the source said detailed talks on boosting North American content would not be held before the end of the round on Tuesday.Canada and Mexico say the new rules of origin are unworkable and would damage the highly-integrated auto industry.?I hope the United States understands there are things ? that Mexico won?t accept, and (I hope) the negotiating process becomes more rational,? Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico?s CCE business lobby, told Reuters.On Friday, the US Trade Representative?s office revised its official objectives to conform to its current demands.The move prompted US Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, to remove a ?hold? he had put in place to block confirmation of two Trump administration nominees for deputy USTR positions, a Wyden aide said.Wyden had complained the trade office was keeping members of Congress ?in the dark?.',real

The Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa reported that coroner?s officials on Thursday identified the man as longtime Santa Rosa resident Tak-Fu Hung. He was one of at least 43 people killed by the fires that raged across a huge swath of wine country.Hung?s granddaughter told the newspaper that her grandfather, who had fought the Communists in China?s 1949 revolution, got as far as the front door of his burning home when he told his 76-year-old wife, Helen, he could not make it through the flames. ?He told her, ?Just go,\'? Rosanne O?Hara said by phone from San Francisco. ?He would not make it. He couldn?t make it.?Helen Hung sought shelter behind a wall in the family?s front yard and later by lying on a neighbor?s driveway for hours as the flames passed over her, O?Hara said. She suffered multiple burns but is recovering. ?The flames went over her repeatedly, but she was far away from brush, so that the fire wasn?t constantly on her,? O?Hara said.Hung was the second centenarian identified as a victim of the fast-moving fires. Charles Rippey, a 100-year-old World War II veteran, also perished in his home. He was believed to be trying to help his 98-year-old wife, Sara, when the couple were overcome by smoke and flames.

Darshan Naik, a member of the Surat unit of KSG, alleged that the collectors had become victims of political parties and thus cancelled the permission.',real
'Officials warn of global religious extremism threat to China\nGERRY SHIH, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/officials-warn-global-religious-extremism-threat-china-46087679\nChinese officials are issuing new warnings about the specter of global religious extremism seeping into the country, following reports of fighters from China\'s Muslim minority fighting alongside militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSharhat Ahan, a top political and legal affairs party official in Xinjiang, on Sunday became the latest official from a predominantly Muslim region to warn about China becoming destabilized by the \"international anti-terror situation\" and calling for a \"people\'s war.\"\n\nOver the past year, regional leaders in Xinjiang, home to the Uighur (pronounced WEE-gur) ethnic minority, have ramped up surveillance measures and police patrols and staged massive rallies intended to showcase the power of the security forces.\n\nThose demonstrations are intended to \"declare war against terrorists, to showcase the party and the government\'s resolve to fight terror, resolve to preserve public safety and (China\'s) mighty combat strength,\" Ahan told officials gathered in Beijing for this month\'s National People\'s Congress.\n\nAlthough some scholars question whether global jihadi networks are active in the country, top Chinese officials are increasingly echoing strands of international discourse to back up claims that Islamic extremism is growing worldwide and needs to be rolled back.\n\nIn recent years, hundreds have died in violent incidents mainly in Xinjiang that officials blame on Uighur separatists inspired by the global Jihadi cause.\n\nWhile it has provided little evidence, the government, says Xinjiang faces a grave separatist threat from Uighur fighters linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. IS released a video in late February purportedly showing Uighur fighters training in Iraq and vowing to strike China, according to the SITE Intelligence Group.\n\nOfficials from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region — which has an ethnic Hui population that is predominantly Muslim but, unlike Xinjiang, rarely sees separatist or religious violence — warned similarly this past week about the perils of Islamic extremism. Speaking at a regional meeting open to the media, Ningxia Communist Party secretary Li Jianhua drew comparisons to the policies of President Donald Trump\'s administration to make his point.\n\n\"What the Islamic State and extremists push is jihad, terror, violence,\" Li said. \"This is why we see Trump targeting Muslims in a travel ban. It doesn\'t matter whether anti-Muslim policy is in the interests of the U.S. or it promotes stability, it\'s about preventing religious extremism from seeping into all of American culture.\"\n\nWu Shimin, a former ethnic affairs official from Ningxia, said that ideological work must be strengthened in the region to promote a Chinese identity among its Hui population, the descendants of Muslim traders plying the Silk Road centuries ago.\n\n\"The roots of the Hui are in China,\" Wu said. \"To discuss religious consciousness, we must first discuss Chinese consciousness. To discuss the feelings of minorities, we must first discuss the feelings of the Chinese people.\"\n\nThe officially atheistic Communist Party has long viewed religion with suspicion but has generally granted a fair degree of religious freedom to its Hui minority, especially in their heartland of Ningxia, where mosques dot the skyline. The party has kept a far tighter grip over Xinjiang\'s Uighurs — who have a language, culture and physical features that are more closely linked to Central Asia — partly due to the existence of a decades-old separatist movement.\n\nBut the comments by party officials in Ningxia, seen as traditionally more lax on ethnic and religious policy, reflected the top Chinese leadership\'s growing anxieties about Islam more broadly over the past year, analysts said.\n\n\"There\'s a strengthening trend of viewing Islam as a problem in Chinese society,\" said Mohammed al-Sudairi, a doctoral student at the University of Hong Kong. \"Xi Jinping has been quite anxious about what he saw as the loss of party-state control over the religious sphere when he entered power, which necessitated this intervention. I don\'t think things will take a softer turn.\"',real

'Malaysia says it will give Kim\'s family time to claim body\nEILEEN NG, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/malaysia-give-kims-family-time-claim-body-46087418\nMalaysia\'s health minister said Monday that the government will give relatives of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\'s estranged half brother two to three weeks to claim his body before deciding what to do with it.\n\nMalaysian authorities say Kim Jong Nam died after two women smeared his face with the banned VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur\'s airport on Feb. 13, but North Korea — which is widely suspected to be behind the attack — rejects the findings.\n\nNorth Korea has demanded the body back from Day One and objected to Malaysia\'s autopsy. Pyongyang also has refused to acknowledge that Kim Jong Nam was the victim and has referred to him as Kim Chol, the name on the passport Kim was carrying when he was attacked in a crowded airport terminal.\n\nOn Friday, Malaysian police confirmed that Kim Chol and Kim Jong Nam was the same person, but refused to say how they identified Kim.\n\n\"Now with the positive identification of the body, we are told that he had a wife or wives and children,\" Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam told reporters on Monday. \"So we hope that those people will respond and come forward to claim the body. In the absence of that, then we will address it as a government ... in trying to find how we are going to take the next step.\"\n\n\"I think after identification, we\'ll give ourselves about two to three weeks to solve the problem,\" he said.\n\nThe body is being kept at a morgue at a Kuala Lumpur hospital.\n\nSince Kim\'s death, relations between the two countries have steadily deteriorated, with each expelling the other\'s ambassador. Last Tuesday, North Korea blocked all Malaysians from leaving the country until a \"fair settlement\" of the case was reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil.\n\nMalaysian Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Monday that negotiations with North Korea were taking place, but he did not give details.\n\nThere are nine Malaysians in North Korea — three embassy staff members and their family members. Some 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia, according to Malaysian officials.\n\nBoth countries have also scrapped visa-free travel for each other\'s citizens.\n\nAlthough Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that Pyongyang must have orchestrated it. Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of chemical weapons.\n\nFour of the seven North Korean suspects being sought by Malaysia are believed to have left the country the day Kim was killed. Police say the other three suspects, including a North Korean diplomat, are believed to be in hiding at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe attack was caught on surveillance video that shows two women going up to Kim and apparently smearing something on his face. He was dead within 20 minutes, authorities say. Two women — one Indonesian, one Vietnamese — have been charged with murder but say they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank.',real
'WikiLeaks\' latest release raises questions about who and why\nDEB RIECHMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/wikileaks-latest-release-raises-questions-46088361\nIt\'s not just who did it, but why.\n\nWikiLeaks\' release of nearly 8,000 documents that purportedly reveal secrets about the CIA\'s tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs has given rise to multiple theories about who stole the documents and for what reason.\n\nPerhaps it was a U.S. spy or contractor who felt jilted. Maybe the CIA was exposed by a foreign country that wanted to embarrass U.S. intelligence. Could it have been a CIA insider worried about Americans\' privacy rights?\n\nSome possible motives behind last week\'s disclosure:\n\nFROM THE SOURCE\n\nIn a statement released with the documents, the anti-secrecy group launched by Julian Assange in 2006 said the source told the organization that there are policy questions in urgent need of public debate Among them were \"whether the CIA\'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers\" and the \"problem of public oversight of the agency.\"\n\nThe CIA, while not confirming that the documents are authentic, isn\'t necessarily buying that explanation.\n\n\"As we\'ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,\" CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said. She said the CIA\'s work would continue \"despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk.\"\n\nRobert Chesney, a national security law expert from the University of Texas School of Law, said WikiLeaks could have put the material online to damage the reputation of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\n\"Julian Assange is in the business of trying to reduce American power. That\'s just fact,\" he said.\n\n\"It\'s about giving the CIA\'s reputation a black eye,\" he said. \"I think they are trying to induce panic and make people even more skeptical of the intelligence agencies.\"\n\nAssange said during an online news conference Thursday that it was \"not true\" that WikiLeaks was focused on the United States. He cited recent publications dealing with Germany and Turkey and numerous references to Russia and China throughout WikiLeaks\' previous releases.\n\n\"People raise this for distracting reasons, to try to question the messenger because the content itself is so powerful,\" he said.\n\n———\n\nJILTED CONTRACTOR\n\nSpies go rogue for many reasons: money, a quest for fame, ego, they are coerced or compromised.\n\nWikiLeaks said the material came from an \"isolated high-security network\" inside the CIA\'s Center for Cyber Intelligence. The group said the material \"appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner\" and that one of them gave WikiLeaks part of this cache.\n\nAssange suggested that spies, former intelligence officials and contractors had been sharing the material, potentially to feed a growing for-profit market in electronic espionage tools. He said it appeared that not only was it being spread among contractors and former American computer hackers for hire, but \"now may be in the black market.\"\n\nTraditionally, money has been a key motive. But Frank Cilluffo, who directs the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University, thinks leakers might leak for different reasons today. \"If they were doing it to make money, why would they go to WikiLeaks?\" he asked.\n\nHe said Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency who leaked classified material exposing U.S. government surveillance programs, was not motivated by money. Likewise, Chelsea Manning, who was convicted of leaking many thousands of classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks while serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq, said she did it not for money but to raise awareness about the war\'s impact on innocent civilians.\n\n———\n\nFOREIGN MEDDLER\n\nIt\'s not impossible to imagine an insider walking out of the CIA with the data, said Bob Ayers, a retired U.S. intelligence officer currently working as an international security analyst based in England.\n\nBut Ayers, who appeared opposite Assange in a debate over whistleblowers in London several years ago, said his instincts are that a foreign country is involved. \"I think the Russians are behind it, I really do,\" he said.\n\nJames Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, also suspects a sleight of hand by the Kremlin, which he says has used WikiLeaks in the past.\n\nHe pointed to WikiLeaks\' statement about receiving the material from a source who thinks there needs to be a debate about whether the CIA\'s hacking exceeds its mandated powers. Lewis said the source who believed that the CIA had gained too much power \"probably lives in Moscow.\"\n\n\"There is a long-term campaign by the Russians to damage the U.S and the intelligence community,\" he said. \"It\'s too early to tell if this is another part of that — although it fits that pattern. I think the biggest concern is that we are in a new kind of fight with Russia and we are losing. The damage from lost tools can be repaired. The damage to reputation takes longer.\"\n\nAssange has long denied claims, often made on flimsy evidence, that he acts on behalf of Russian interests. Asked Thursday by an American journalist whether he had received any money from the Russian state, Assange said no and that it was a \"pretty sad question.\"\n\nAnd this past week, Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denied any Russian involvement in hacking.\n\n———\n\nAMERICANS\' RIGHT TO KNOW\n\nWikiLeaks said the source of the documents wants to start a public debate about \"the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons.\"\n\nBen Wizner is Snowden\'s lawyer and the director of the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. He said if WikiLeaks is accurately representing the source\'s intentions, then there seems to be success in stirring a public debate about the balance between the need to protect networks used daily by Americans and the government\'s need to conduct surveillance operations against adversaries.\n\n\"To the extent that the documents help inform a public debate about what the balance should be between the government\'s offensive surveillance operations and defensive cybercapabilities, then the documents have contributed to an important public conversation,\" Wizner said.\n\nBut he also wondered whether the source wanted the documents released with parts blacked out. WikiLeaks has previously voiced disgust with the idea of censoring documents, even in part, saying that doing so \"legitimizes the false propaganda of \'information is dangerous.\'\"\n\nWikiLeaks has not answered questions from The Associated Press about why it applied redactions this time or whether it was done at the source\'s request. Knowing the answer to those questions, Wizner said, might help with understanding what motivated the release.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press writer Raphael Satter in London contributed to this report.',real

'A familiar name: Democrat Kennedy fights GOP on health care\nMARY CLARE JALONICK, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/familiar-democratic-kennedy-fights-gop-health-care-46088499\nA familiar name from Massachusetts, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, is carrying his family legacy into a new era, battling Republicans who want to undo Barack Obama\'s health care law.\n\nKennedy, the 36-year-old grandson of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and great-nephew of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy, has been a low-key presence in the House since he was first elected in his Boston-area district in 2012. But he emerged last week as a major Democratic voice against the Republican health care bill, delivering several speeches in a committee\'s all-night session that have been viewed millions of times on the internet.\n\nWhile the technology may be new, his support for the Obama-era health care law and more services for the poor are familiar Kennedy territory. Sen. Ted Kennedy spent decades pushing for comprehensive health care before his death from brain cancer in August 2009.\n\nNow his great-nephew is fighting Republicans who are trying to unravel the 2010 law. They say the system is failing as premiums have risen and insurers have pulled out.\n\nKennedy challenged House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had called the GOP replacement bill an \"act of mercy.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to our speaker, he and I must have read different scripture,\" Kennedy said during the debate. \"The one that I read calls on us to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to shelter the homeless, and to comfort the sick. It reminds us that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful, but how we care for the least among us.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is not an act of mercy. It\'s an act of malice.\"\n\nHis office posted the video on Facebook, and as of Monday, it had almost 10 million views and more than 225,000 shares.\n\nKennedy acknowledged his family legacy but stressed that he can\'t allow it to overwhelm his actions.\n\n\"I obviously am very proud of what my family has accomplished and what they have done,\" he said in an interview, but \"if you try to do this job and carry that weight around, you\'re never going to be able to do anything.\"\n\nWhen talking about his grandfather\'s speeches, he is emotional, putting his hand on his heart. \"God, have you read some of his speeches?\" he asks, and notes that a one-minute viral clip is an easier task.\n\nIt\'s clear that he\'d rather be talking about the details of his opposition to the health bill.\n\nDuring the committee debate, he criticized the bill for its one-year freeze in Planned Parenthood funding, and the resulting decrease in health services for women, and the repeal of a requirement that state Medicaid plans must provide \"essential health benefits,\" including mental health care.\n\nA separate Facebook video of him talking about mental health care has more than 4 million views.\n\nThat issue is important in his family — mainly to his cousin, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, who left Congress in 2011 and has since been open about his own battles with substance abuse and mental health.\n\nNow an advocate for increased mental health services, Patrick Kennedy says his cousin \"managed to capture a moment when all eyes were on health care, and focus it with laser precision.\"\n\nHe says Joe is the right person to carry on the family legacy.\n\n\"Most members have to be around for a long time and pay their dues before they garner the kind of credibility he\'ll have,\" Patrick said of Joe. \"The fact is, is he going to use that to good purpose? As he demonstrated this week, he is not only prepared but is using to good purpose that incredible family legacy he was given by birth.\"\n\nOne of Kennedy\'s good friends in Congress is Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a 39-year-old Oklahoma Republican who entered Congress with Kennedy four years ago and says he disagrees with the Massachusetts Democrat on almost everything. Mullin says they joke a lot, but they rarely joke about health care. They both sit on the Energy and Commerce Committee, where they took opposite sides on the bill last week.\n\n\"He doesn\'t speak out very often. He\'s not someone that is front and center,\" Mullin said. \"But health care is something that is very important to him.\"\n\nThe internet took notice, with retweets and Twitter shout-outs from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who tweeted: \"Wow. This is a Kennedy who could be President. A must watch.\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi cited his \"passion and his leadership.\"\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a lawmaker who worked with both Ted Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy before Joe came to Congress, says his party needs more young people talking about the benefits of the health care law, since many don\'t think it helps them.\n\nJoe Kennedy says millennials are engaged, apolitical, want the system to work and want solutions.\n\n\"Trying to get to some of the solutions here is difficult,\" Kennedy said. \"But we need to find a way to get there.\"',real
'Turkey-Netherlands feud simmers as Dutch election looms\nSUZAN FRASER, ASSOCIATED PRESS\nt\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/turkey-formally-protests-ministers-treatment-netherlands-46088978\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the Netherlands in its spat with Turkey on Monday as NATO\'s chief called for alliance members to respect each other and the European Union urged Turkey to calm down.\n\nThe flap is over the Netherlands\' refusal to allow Turkish officials to campaign there to drum up support among Turks who are eligible to vote in an April 16 referendum that would greatly expand the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nErdogan\'s strong reaction to scenes of Dutch police repelling Turkish protesters is fueling nationalism back home and bolstering his image as a protector of Turkish people against a hostile world.\n\nOn Monday, Turkey\'s foreign ministry formally protested the treatment of a Turkish minister who was escorted out of the Netherlands after trying to attend a weekend referendum rally. The ministry also objected to what it called a \"disproportionate\" use of force against demonstrators at a protest afterward.\n\nTurkey had a similar dispute with Germany last week, but the fight with the Netherlands comes as that country prepares for its own election Wednesday pitting Prime Minister Mark Rutte\'s right-wing PVV Party against far-right, anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders\' party. Wilders had called on the Dutch government to bar Turkish ministers from the Netherlands until after the election.\n\nRutte, who did not want to be seen backing down to Turkish threats, enraged Ankara by refusing to let Turkey\'s foreign minister land in the Netherlands on Saturday and denying the country\'s family and social policies minister access to the Turkish Consulate in downtown Rotterdam.\n\nErdogan vowed to retaliate against the Netherlands after claiming that \"Nazism is alive in the West.\"\n\nMerkel, speaking at a news conference in Munich on Monday, pledged her \"full support and solidarity\" to the Dutch, saying the Nazi gibes were \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe European Union called on Turkey to \"refrain from excessive statements and actions that risk further exacerbating the situation.\" EU spokesman Margaritis Schinas added that it was essential to avoid further escalation and find ways to calm the situation.\n\nTurkey is a candidate to join the European Union, although the membership negotiations have made little progress over the past decade. The country has become a vital partner in a deal with the EU to curb the passage of migrants and refugees from Turkey into Europe.\n\nOmer Celik, Turkey\'s minister in charge of European Union affairs, said Monday that his country should consider reviewing the migration deal to relax controls on people reaching Europe by walking into Greece or Bulgaria.\n\n\"In my opinion the issue of the land passages should be reviewed,\" the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.\n\nMost of the hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees who flooded Europe in 2015 came by boat from Turkey to Greece, then traveled from there to more prosperous countries to the north and west. Celik said Turkey should continue preventing those crossings because they\'re dangerous.\n\nAlso Monday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged all members of the alliance \"to show mutual respect, to be calm and have a measured approach.\"\n\nThe Dutch, meanwhile, issued a travel advisory to their citizens to \"be alert and avoid gatherings and busy places throughout Turkey.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Turkey summoned the Dutch Embassy\'s charge d\'affaires, Daan Feddo Huisinga, to the Foreign Ministry, where a senior official handed him two formal protest notes. It\'s the third time the Dutch diplomat has been summoned since tensions broke out between the two countries.\n\nThe first note protested the treatment of Family Affairs Minister Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, who was escorted out of the Netherlands after she entered by road from Germany to try to attend a rally to support the referendum to expand Erdogan\'s powers. About 400,000 people with ties to Turkey live in the Netherlands, though it\'s not clear how many are eligible to vote.\n\nThe second note protested the treatment of Turkish citizens who had gathered outside the Turkish Consulate in Rotterdam from Saturday night into Sunday morning, saying \"disproportionate force\" had been used against \"people using their right to peaceful gatherings.\" At a separate protest by Turks in Amsterdam on Sunday night, Dutch riot police arrested 13 people, spokeswoman Marjolein Koek said. Media showed police with dogs and a water cannon being used to disperse protesters in western Amsterdam.\n\n———\n\nAssociated Press Writers Mike Corder in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.',real
'As I trundled down the hilly road with a carefree gait, enjoying the scenic beauty around me, I came across a group of young men. Quickly, I averted my gaze. Much to my surprise, they greeted me with a namaste and I was left with no other option but to respond. The brief interaction ended here, but what startled me was my hesitation in replying. My apprehensive behaviour made me wonder whether I would have reacted the same way if they were foreigners. Perhaps not. Then why did I feel alarmed by local men? How did I cultivate the behaviour of mistrust? Had living in Delhi conditioned me to look away to avoid lewd gestures? I wasn?t sure. But I knew one thing: the blinkers that I wear whenever I am on the road needed to be taken off. And since I had embarked on my first solo trip to Kasar Devi, Uttarakhand, I should be more open to the world and keep personal biases aside.I had stumbled upon this idyllic hamlet in Almora quite accidently. Its ?hippie? history was more intriguing to me than its religious significance ? that it gets its name from the revered Kesar Devi temple. Several hippies thronged this place ? also known as Crank?s Ridge ? in the 1960s. Bob Dylan was here too and so was Swami Vivekananda, but only to meditate. Over the years, it has become a popular hub for backpackers and trekkers.My intention wasn?t trekking as I had come here during the monsoon, a time unsuitable for any such adventurous expedition. Still, I was one among few who had dared to brave landslides. Day one was spent mostly in discovering the hidden corners of the village ? homestays, general stores, schools and village trails. The flowers were in full bloom and the trees, bathed in fresh dew, seemed inviting. Quietude had descended over the place and it was devoid of tourists. It almost looked as if I had arrived at a party before time. As evening drew close, the stillness of the day was broken by the shrill sound of insects. Their symphony made the walk towards my homestay on a starless night magical.Next morning, I woke up to the sound of rain. The room opened to spectacular views of the Panchachuli, though a mist of clouds enveloped the majestic hills during my entire stay otherwise. I decided to explore Jageshwar temple next, which was about 35 kms where I was staying. Once the rain stopped, I stepped out, travelling in local buses and jeeps to reach my destination. While travelling, I always use public transport: one, it makes the trip budget-friendly and, two, using public modes of commuting allows one to come out of the cocoon of isolation and mistrust that most city-dwellers have woven around them. I was no exception.However, my heart sank when I reached the temple, comprising a cluster of 124 large and small stone temples. Mindless construction of shops and restaurants around the temple had clearly disturbed its tranquility. The only consolation was to look into its intricate details and the painstakingly carved human and animal figures on the stones. But the prize discovery of this trip turned out to be a walk from the main road to the temple amid thick deodar and pine trees. While their tall branches kissed the sky, rays of fading sunlight struggled to filter through the canopy of trees. Meditative and quaint, a stream flowing steadily by gave me constant company.So absorbed was I in the moment that I lost track of time. It was well past afternoon. The frequency of buses and jeeps reduces drastically after 2 pm, I was told, and, as I waited patiently, I struck up a conversation with a local who spoke about the region?s flora and fauna. Time was ticking away and there was no bus in sight. I was getting anxious. ?Would you mind going with a local?? he asked. I had no option but to agree. Within 10 minutes, he stopped a young guy on a scooty and I soon found myself riding pillion. We talked nonchalantly, and a soft smile refused to leave my lips until I reached my homestay. Throughout the ride I kept thinking, ?Finally, I did leave my blinkers behind. Even if it?s only for a day.?',real
'The Governing Body (GB) of Dyal Singh College (DSC), in a meeting held Friday, decided that Dyal Singh (Evening) College would be called ?Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya? once it is converted to a morning college. Since Dyal Singh (Morning) College already exists, Dyal Singh (Evening) College ? set up in 1958 and the first evening college in Delhi University ? will have to be renamed. Chairman of the Governing Body, Amitabh Sinha, a BJP leader and a lawyer, said the name was picked ?to pay obeisance to the mother?. Sinha said the GB?s resolution, finalising the college name, has been sent to the DU Vice-Chancellor, who will take ?necessary action? and give formal approval.On September 21, Dyal Singh (Evening) principal Pawan K Sharma had received a notification that the Executive Council has given approval to the evening college becoming a full-fledged day college. While the college has shifted to morning timings ? both for official work and classes ? a DU-appointed committee is in the process of demarcating and sharing physical assets of the two colleges. Even on Friday, some teachers and students protested against the bifurcation process, outside the GB meeting venue.The college was earlier considering the name, ?Madan Mohan Malviya College?. It is currently named after Dyal Singh Majithia, who founded the The Tribune newspaper in 1881 and the Punjab National Bank in 1894. The college website says Majithia also set up an education trust in 1895 for a ?truly secular college?, and DSC was born out of that trust.Explaining why ?Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya? was chosen over ?Madan Mohan Malviya College?, Sinha told The Indian Express, ?Woh (Malviya) kiske bachche the? Hum unhi ko pranaam kar rahe hain. Maa ka darza sabse upar hota hai aur unhe pranaam karna hai. (Whose child was Malviya? We are paying respect to her. The stature of the mother is above all else).

The whole thing has to be right and they have to be happy.?Sanchez?s close-range strike sealed victory for Arsenal over Tottenham after Shkodran Mustafi had headed the open goal five minutes earlier.The result lifted Arsenal to fifth in the Premier League, one point behind Tottenham, and earned them a first victory in the north London derby in seven attempts.?We played with purpose, good concentration, the desire to be always efficient and with great solidarity from the first to last minute,? Wenger said.?The quality of our concentration was very high. We never had a minute where we could feel we dropped a little bit our focus.?Mustafi?s goal came with a double dose of controversy. The free kick from which he scored was given for a disputable foul by Davinson Sanchez on Sanchez and replays showed Mustafi was marginally offside.?Two weeks ago we conceded a goal that was not marginally offside, it was a yard offside, and nobody found a word to say,? Wenger said.?I watched it again (Mustafi?s goal) ? it?s not true that he was offside. And it was a foul.',real
'An Insignificant Man movie director: Khushboo Ranka, Vinay Shukla?\r\nAn Insignificant Man movie rating: 3 starsIt?s not just the events that An Insignificant Man captures, important though they are in many ways, that makes this feature length documentary significant.Of course, it is in the very subject. It is about politics, and it is deeply political. But equally, it is in the very fact of it being released for public exhibition this week. Films in India run the risk of denied certification on the flimsiest of excuses, and this one is a hot potato: an up close, detailed record of the formation of a political party which was born out of citizen protests, and out of a very vocal dissatisfaction with the system, and widespread corruption in its very fabric.The directors are clearly present, and yet keep themselves out of the frame, except in one or two inadvertent flashes. What they, and we, get is a fascinating account of how a brand new political entity comes about, from grounds up. The Aam Aadmi Party was born out of protest and a strong egalitarian sense of right and wrong: here were the ?aam aadmi??, and there were those who were in power, and there was a huge rift in between.The major dramatis personae are, of course, Arvind Kejriwal and his early lieutenants (some, like the analyst Yogendra Yadav, are no longer part of AAP, having been expelled for ?anti-party activities?). From a tax officer to a protestor, to an activist, to a reluctant rookie politician, to winning an election, and to becoming the chief minister of New Delhi, the film is the journey of Kejriwal, and his AAP.Because no other party gives access to the filmmakers (this is mentioned in the credits), except for televised excerpts and public meetings, the film has Kejriwal and co in focus: in conversation with potential voters, in a rare relaxed moment, in strategizing, and finally, in the historic win at the hustings.That a day can be a long time in politics is evident right during the film itself: was Yadav already distancing himself from Kejriwal even before the formal parting of ways? The film shows Yadav in the crowd, far away from the dais, where Kejriwal is taking oath. Is Kejriwal really, in his heart, a small, insignificant man (?main toh ek bahut chota aadmi hoon?, he repeats in the film), when he starts off? Was he always really the autocrat that so many people accuse him of being, or does being in power does that to him? Then how is he or his party different from those he fought?Even for those who were following the events very closely on a day to day basis, the film is a bracing refresh: the sense of wild exhilaration that even the most cynical amongst us felt, when AAP swept the elections in 2013, dissipated soon after as the party fell from grace. In events that followed, it resurrected itself, and won Delhi again.Right now, AAP still rules Delhi. But how many of us still feel as thrilled as we did when it first beat the mighty old parties (Congress, BJP) on the plank of corruption, and the chants of we-will-change-everything?',real
'A smiling Roy Moore stood shoulder to shoulder with his fiercest religious allies.Flanked by a huge sign for Moore?s Senate campaign, one supporter railed against the ?LGBT mafia? and ?homosexualist gay terrorism.? Another warned that ?homosexual sodomy? destroys those who participate in it and the nations that allow it. And still another described same-sex marriage as ?a mirage? because ?it?s phony and fake.?Thursday?s news conference was designed to send a powerful message to the political world that religious conservatives across America remain committed to Moore, a Christian conservative and former judge whose Alabama Senate campaign has been rocked by mounting allegations of sexual misconduct. The event also revealed an aggressive strain of homophobia rarely seen in mainstream politics _ in recent years, at least.In the days since, religious liberals have stepped forward to express their opposition to Moore. More than 50 Alabama pastors signed a letter saying Moore has demonstrated ?extremist values? incompatible with traditional Christianity and is unfit to serve in the Senate. And an anti-Moore rally at a Birmingham church on Saturday drew more than 100 people, some of whom carried signs decrying his opposition to gay rights.But in a Senate campaign suddenly hyper focused on Moore?s relationships with teenage girls decades ago, Moore?s hardline stance on gay rights and other LGBT issues has become little more than an afterthought for many voters as Election Day approaches.Moore first caught the attention of many in the LGBT community after describing homosexual conduct as ?an inherent evil against which children must be protected? in a 2002 child custody case involving a lesbian mother. In a 2005 television interview, Moore said ?homosexual conduct should be illegal.? He also said there?s no difference between gay sex and sex with a cow, horse or dog.Moore?s stand _ combined with the fiery comments from his supporters _ unnerved some in Birmingham?s relatively small LGBT community.?It made me extremely angry,? said Mackenzie Gray, a 37-year-old who came out as transgender in 2010. She says most people in her life don?t know she was born a man.?My fear with the religious leaders and the hateful rhetoric we?re hearing is that it?s going to start escalating into something even larger,? Gray said. ?It?s dangerous.?Indeed, other LGBT activists suggested this week that open acceptance of Moore?s anti-gay rhetoric harkens to a dark and violent time in Alabama history.Moore?s Democratic challenger, Doug Jones, is known best, perhaps, for prosecuting the men who bombed Birmingham?s 16th Street Baptist Church _ a prosecution that came nearly 40 years after the 1963 crime that killed four black girls. Racial tensions have lingered in the state, even as the violence lessened. In 2000, Alabama became the last state in the country to overturn its ban on interracial marriage.The state has been slow to embrace gay rights as well: 81 percent of voters supported a ban on same-sex marriage in 2006. Only neighboring Mississippi, with 86 percent, scored higher.Patricia Todd, the state?s first openly gay state representative, says she has faced at least four death threats in recent years. One woman called Todd?s cell phone and vowed to kill her and her family, she said, noting that local LGBT leaders meet quarterly at the FBI office in Birmingham to help identify potential hate crimes.?It?s been brutal, but it?s gotten to the point where I just laugh at them,? Todd said Friday. She?s not laughing at Moore.?It?s awful because he says the most hateful things,? she said.In contrast to many conservative politicians with national ambitions, Moore has made little attempt to change his tone on LGBT issues as equal rights for the gay community has earned increasing acceptance among mainstream America.Moore?s hero status among many Christian conservatives was cemented in 2016 when, as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he refused to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. He was later suspended, the second time he was forcibly removed from the state Supreme Court.Earlier this month, Moore said, ?The transgenders don?t have rights,? during a news conference, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.Moore?s unapologetic positions _ and his repeated promises to take them to the U.S. Senate if elected on Dec. 12 _ were celebrated at Thursday?s news conference by the religious leaders who traveled from as far as Colorado, Ohio and Texas to stand at his side.Rabbi Noson Leiter, who once called Hurricane Sandy?s destruction ?divine justice? for same-sex marriage, lashed out at ?homosexualist gay terrorism.??We need Judge Moore to stand up to the LGBT transgender mafia,? Leiter said. He added, ?We need someone with a proven record of facing off against the gay terrorists.?Another Moore supporter, Texas Christian activist Steven Hotze, warned in 2015 that children would be ?encouraged to practice sodomy in kindergarten? as a result of same-sex marriage. On Thursday, Hotze refused to describe the union of two gay people as marriage: ?It?s ?mirage? because it?s just like a mirage _ it?s phony and it?s fake.?North Carolina-based Christian activist Flip Benham last year warned in a Charlotte City Council meeting that the policies that protect the civil rights of transgender people would trigger ?bloodshed coursing down the corners of our streets.??We?re praising everything that God says is wrong and will destroy you,? he said Thursday. ?Homosexual sodomy destroys those who participate in that behavior and nations that approve of it.?He offered a pointed message to Moore?s critics: God ?doesn?t send anyone to hell. It?s a place you choose to go.?',real

'Principals of various state and central universities from across the country Thursday gathered in the city for an orientation programme on the issue of autonomous colleges, organised by the University Grants Commission. Sources said principals of Delhi University (DU) were assured that autonomy would not result in any fund cut towards their institutions. The meeting saw the presence of K K Sharma, Secretary, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development and UGC Chairman V S Chauhan.?They explained the Autonomous College Scheme and clarified that there will be no impact on the funds. They said we will continue to get the same funding as we?re getting now. Colleges will get autonomy to start their own courses, formulate their own syllabus and hold their own examinations. The results will be declared by the university. Also, on the degree, the name of the college will be mentioned although it will be given by the university,? said S K Garg, Principal of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College.Garg said colleges with ?A? grade given by NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) could apply for autonomous status. However, other principals said there was much ?confusion? about its implementation and that authorities were not able to adequately answer the questions posed by principals.?They said colleges which have one stream will get Rs 9 lakh as funding annually, those who have two-three streams would get somewhere around Rs 15 lakh. The money isn?t enough? On the one hand they say colleges will get autonomy to frame their own syllabus, but on the other hand they have also implemented CBCS (Choice-Based Credit System) which gives a uniform syllabus for all colleges,? a DU principal told The Indian Express.',real
'IT HAS been a year since the Bhangar land agitation started, sparking violence in South 24 Parganas over the state government?s attempt to construct a power sub-station. The protesters, who have been trying to organise themselves politically since then, are now mulling contesting the next year?s panchayat elections.Over the last few months, 11 village committees have been set up in Polerhat II gram panchayat area, where Bhangar is located. Following this, on October 29, thousands of villagers had attended a sammelan and set up umbrella committee JJPBRC ? Jami, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee (Committee to secure Land, Livelihood, Environment and Ecosystem). The committee, primarily comprising villagers, will approve any development project to be taken up in the area. JJPBRC convener and spokesperson, Mirza Hassan, said: ?We are looking at all possibilities, including fighting the panchayat elections. It depends on whether the state government agrees to all our demands. But we are looking at fighting the elections.?JJPBRC, as well as the 11 village committees, will hold several meetings over the coming months to take a final call, he added.?A number of Opposition leaders have come and supported us. CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty, for instance, attended the sammelan and lent his and his party?s support to us,? said Hassan.\r\nFrom October 15 to October 27, 16 villages had held a series of meetings to set up 11 committees. Each committee, with between 40 and 125 members, will look after the general affairs of the villages. ?The committees will access and approve development projects, which the panchayat or the government may take up. These will also monitor progress of government schemes and probe corruption. Basically, any decision to do with the village, however minor, will be taken by the concerned village committee,? said Hasan.Incidentally, little-known Naxal group CPI(ML) Red Star, under the name Jami, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee, had spearheaded the Bhangar agitation last year.CPM insiders said JJPBRC was set up following the party?s traditional model ? several village committees coming together to set up a larger umbrella committee.Experts said what is more significant is that the nature of activities that have taken place in Bhangar over the past few months mirrors the Singur and Nandigram land movements, which had catapulted Trinamool Congress to power in 2011.In Singur, the agitation was carried out under the banner of Singur Krishi Jami Raksha Committee. In Nadigram, it was Bhoomi Ucched Pratibadh Committee and later in Lalgarh, People?s Committee against Police Atrocities. In all three cases, the umbrella committees had dozens of village committees working under them, mobilising booth level voters and ensuring the toppling of the Left Front government.In Bhangar, while villagers are keen on contesting as independent candidates, they seem to have the full backing of both the Congress and CPM. Besides Sujan Chakraborty, leader of Opposition Abdul Mannan, Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra and Left chairman Biman Basu have visited the area over the last few months. So have rights activist Binayak Sen, politician Yogendra Yadav and CPM?s peasant leaders Hannan Mollah and Biju Krishnan.\r\nThis is in stark contrast from the time Opposition leaders were not allowed into Bhangar by the government. But committee members maintained that their resistance has been so strong that not only have they been able to hold meetings, but now Trinamool leaders are being forced to stay away.When the Bhangar agitation was at its peak, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that no move would be made to construct the power grid without the permission of the villagers. She has subsequently dropped UAPA charges against many protesters. A key leader of the movement, Alik Chakraborty, is now out of prison while still facing charges under UAPA.',real

'The debit and credit card transactions have jumped to Rs 74,090 crore in September this year, up a hefty 84 per cent as compared to the same month last year when it stood at Rs 40,130 crore, thanks to the government push for non-cash payments, says a study.?The transaction volume at all points of sale (POSes) clipped higher by 86 per cent to 378 million in September this year over the same period last year when it stood at 203 million, European payment solutions provider Worldline said in a weekend report quoting the Reserve Bank data.In September 2016 the number stood at 203 million, it added.?With demonetisation, people were pushed to use non-cash modes of payment for everyday expenses. Even after the cash is back to the pre-demonetisation levels, there is a visible growth in card transactions,? Deepak Chandnani, chief executive of Worldline South Asia & Middle East, told PTI.The push to increase cards usage started with the Prime Minister Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014, the survey said.Total number of cards as of September 2017 stood at 853 million. Of this, 33.3 million were credit cards and 819.8 million were debit cards.There was a marked spurt, especially for debit cards, which shot by 39 per cent in 2015 because of the new Jan Dhan accounts. Post-demonetisation, growth has been averaging at 22 per cent, the survey added.The growth of credit cards from 2016 to 2017 has been 24 per cent, higher than the average growth but consistent with the trend of the past few years, the study said.Between 2011 and 2016, credit cards have seen a steady 9 per cent increase.The study further said digital payment companies have seen a substantial jump in business following the government?s push towards cashless transactions after the note-ban last November, and the major contributor to this growth was online payments.According to RBI, after the note-ban, digital transactions rose 31 per cent from last November to this September.Growth rate of the digital payments industry, which was earlier in the range of 20-50 per cent, has accelerated post-demonetisation to over 40 per cent.As of September, the number of transactions on the unified payments interface (UPI) jumped 85 per cent in a month. The rise in UPI adoption is also facilitated by the rise in smartphone users and increased availability of 3G and 4G data (89 per cent of total mobile data), the survey said.',real
'Suggesting test-takers how to tackle an exam is always a tricky business and when it comes to CAT it?s an even more formidable task. Before getting into the analysis of errors to avoid during CAT 2017 based on relevant data it is imperative to understand the objective of aptitude and ability tests. These tests are designed to assess one?s logical reasoning or thinking performance.CAT is strictly timed and as a typical exam, it tests one?s ability to perform under pressure, observation skills and decision-making.First thing first: As soon as the test starts one should leaf through the entire question paper and divide it into easy, moderate and difficult categories of questions. After this jump to the easiest question in which one is very comfortable. This will not merely fetch marks for those particular questions rather it will help in boosting the confidence for the entire test.?Read |?CAT 2017: Toppers share last weeks? preparation?tips, click hereBias: It has been observed that students go for the questions for a particular chapter based on his or her special liking for the area. The interesting part is that sometimes these questions are deliberately asked only to trap students, they spend a lot of time on this and mostly come out exhausted and short of time. After analysing the way how test takers devote time on different question, it evinces that so many easy questions remain untouched even though they are extremely easy. Contrary to common belief that they are from so-called difficult chapter!Easy to solve easy to comprehend: One more interesting fact comes out from our analysis is that student go by the length of the question and jugglery of the language. For example, if length of the question is very short it will get priority over so called lengthy question and same applies for language of the question. One shouldn?t have stuck if the language of the question is not very lucid what happens actually is these questions can be solved merely by the data given in between lines. So one shouldn?t keep niggling on the words of the question or other language jugglery.Never pre-fix a target especially in terms of number of questions: \r\nTry to segregate the doable questions as per your strength and weakness. Try to attempt as many questions after shortlisting the questions to optimise speed and accuracy. One should not forget that there is no any co-relation between percentage and percentile scores.Accuracy dips at last minutes: After analysing the order in which question is attempted and corresponding probability of its correctness it evince that first few questions are having higher probability of correctness. As everything remains same it comes to a student?s psychology. What happens is he or she loses concentration when the test draws towards end.Do not lose hope after the first section. You may outperform all others in the remaining two. At the same time, do not carry the failure of the previous question/section. Neither be too excited nor too dejected. Remain focused for a clinical performance.',real
'The Union Ministry of Finance has turned down the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation?s revised budget demand for Rs 925 crore by pointing out that the urban local body should generate its own revenue rather than asking for additional funds.The move will affect many development projects of the city which were approved by the general house. Estimates were ready as the MC is already going into deep financial crisis. A senior officer of the UT Administration said, ?We have conveyed the ministry decision to the MC Commissioner.?The financial position of the MC is so bad that they have been using fixed deposits to pay salaries. Every year, MC has to pay Rs 360 crore as salaries while the revenue from its own sources is just Rs 150 crore. The fixed deposits, which amounted to Rs 500 crore six years ago, have come down to around Rs 180 crore now.In February this year, in its budget meet, the MC had approved the budget of Rs 1,005 crore. Chief Accounts Officer Uma Shankar Sharma said that they had been given only Rs 269 crore, an amount which is not even sufficient to pay salaries, what to talk of development works. Following this, they asked for a revised budget of Rs 925 crore.Municipal Commissioner Jitender Yadav told Chandigarh Newsline the projected budget amount included the revenue and capital budget. ?We have been getting less grants in the last five years. They are almost frozen. Salaries have to be paid. Fixed deposits have reduced,? he said.The estimate of road recarpeting in the city has been prepared for around Rs 35 crore while that of footpaths with PCC tiles has already been approved for Rs 20 crore.Construction work of several new community centres and renovation of existing ones for about Rs 20 crore is already on while a grid sub-station of 66KV had to be set up again for Rs 20 crore.

'A day after it was decided that Dyal Singh (Evening) College would be called ?Vande Mataram Mahavidyalaya? once it is converted to a morning college, Rajouri Garden MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa opposed the move. Sirsa ? who is from the Shiromani Akali Dal, a BJP ally ? said the name change would negate the legacy of Dyal Singh Majithia, after whom the college is named, as it was his efforts that resulted in the college getting its land on lease in 1960. ?Dyal Singh (Evening) College is an important part of the Dyal Singh Trust. Changing the name is like negating his legacy,? Sirsa said. ?We will not let the name change happen. If it is not revoked, it would result in unpleasant protests,?

Union of India (NSUI) said they ?will welcome this new trend of renaming colleges if students are provided proper infrastructure and facilities?. They also sought an explanation from the college?s Governing Body on how two day colleges can function from an 11-acre campus. ?There are 6,000 and 2,500 students in the Morning and Evening colleges respectively. The evening college students have been promised a separate building, but nothing has been done so far.?Neeraj Mishra, communication-in-charge of NSUI, said: ?The annual exam is held in the canteen due to lack of space.

Amber?s managing director Daljit Singh said.The IPO comprises fresh issue of shares worth Rs 450 crore and an offer-for-sale to the tune of Rs 105 crore.The Hong Kong-based private equity player ADV Partners holds around 41 per cent in the company and the remaining stake is with the promoters/promoter group.Singh said the promoters would continue to remain majority owners even after the IPO, but did not divulge the details of the stake they would be offloading.Amber has 10 manufacturing facilities across seven locations and is open inorganic growth but Singh did not share details.The company also makes refrigerator components, water purifiers and washing machines but is primarily focused on air conditioners.?Air-conditioners are the least penetrated and there is a lot of potential in this segment. We are strong enough to cater to the future demand,? Singh said, adding that he has no plans to launching private labels in the segment.Amber had around Rs 1,650 crore revenue last fiscal, with room ACs contributing 65 to 70 per cent of sales and the remaining from components.',real
'A whistle. Then, boom. Seven short blasts and a long hoarse boom. The Baltic Sea was frigid, the breeze bitter and the sunbed on my private deck the colour of a doleful Danish sky. After a long flight from Mumbai to Copenhagen, I had put my feet up on a 1,46,000 tonne, 1,068-ft long Norwegian Getaway cruise liner, when the maritime distress signal roared. My mind immediately remembered vignettes of drowning men, floating dinner plates and chaos aboard the doomed Titanic. Boom. I had to run to the muster point, F9. I wrapped a scarlet dourukha (shawl) and ran down the staircase. At F9, women in little black dresses and pearl chokers were sitting crosslegged with goblets in hand, men were guffawing and stewards looked relaxed. This did not smell of any catastrophe. ?There is no emergency. This is a mandatory drill?, a guttural voice bellowed.With that began my eight-day, 1,992 nautical mile cruise through six cities in Europe and Russia. After the drill, I plonked on a white Chesterfield and ran through the itinerary ? sailing from Copenhagen (Denmark), docking in ports of Warnemunde (Germany), Tallinn (Estonia), Helsinki (Finland),?St Petersburg (Russia), Nynashamn (Sweden) ? and two days entirely on the sea.But before I could feel blue about the sea-bound days, there was an array of services to choose from. Swim in a heated pool on deck 15; slough off urban malice in the spa; get butt-numb in an ice bar, sitting on an ice chair and sipping out of an ice glass; pick from 22 eating joints manned by 233 chefs; watch movies on two-storey high television screens. The to-do list on the ship was unending. The Norwegian Getaway resembled a tony town with 4,000 guests and 1,650 employees to man it.In that tony town of a cruise ship, every morning there was a near mass exodus. After a large breakfast, one had to line up in the theatre space, a yellow ticket in hand, to get a bus number glued to your chest. Then, down the stairs to listen to the instructions and off for the day trip. On Day 2, it was a three-hour train ride from Warnemunde port to Berlin where the bus meandered through iconic buildings, including the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Neue Synagogue, Kaiser Wilhelm Church (where the walls are made of a concrete honeycomb containing 21,292 stained glass inlays), the Berlin Wall, now covered in graffiti), and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe with 27,111 concrete slabs that resemble coffins. The unnamed coffins look strangely bare ? no epitaph, no tears, no flowers, no votive candles.It had rained in Warnemunde. The wharf was slippery but the painted mermaid on the hull looked gleeful. Berlin was a burden on my heart ? I would have retreated to my room, but for a song that lured me to Deck 7, where a man in black was belting out an Elvis Presley number. A teppanyaki chef ensured giggles as he juggled three eggs on a spatula and pulled a toy chick out of his toque.By Day 3, I was a pro at the morning exodus. Following the guide like an obedient school girl, I strolled in the rainy city of Tallinn ? where a tower is called Fat Margaret and WiFi is considered a human right. Another day, the ship hooted to a halt in Helsinki. The routine repeated in St Petersburg and Stockholm. Sadly, I had barely half a day in Stockholm. If I could stretch time, I would have happily booked a seat in Teater Dur och Moll, Europe?s smallest theatre that can only seat 20. Or, booked a table in Restaurant Stadshusk?llaren that serves Nobel Prize banquet meals with menus dating from 1901 to now.',real
'The Binay Tamang-Anit Thapa led faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) will hold its first ever public meeting at 11 am in Darjeeling on Sunday after the two leaders were expelled from the GJM by party chief Bimal Gurung in September. It will also be the first ever meeting after the state government had set up a Board of Administrators for the Hills, with Tamang as its chairman.While the faction had held several smaller meetings in Kurseong (Thapa?s stronghold) and in Kalimpong, the Sunday?s meeting is likely to determine whether it has actually gained traction in the Hills following the over three-month-long indefinite bandh for a separate state of Gorkhaland.Darjeeling has always been a stronghold of Gurung and his own constituency, Tukvar, falls in the district.\r\nThapa, one of the main speakers at Sunday?s meeting, admitted that the rally is being held to determine how much strength their faction has gained.?We will of course talk about our plans, our (future) road map, what development projects we have in mind for the Hills, how they will be implemented and how we plan to take the cause of Gorkhaland forward. But, essentially the meeting is being held to see how much traction we have gained, and how much support we have managed to garner in Darjeeling,? he said.Thapa added that their faction has held numerous meetings in Kurseong, Kalimpong and other areas over the last few months. He said that according to their estimates, the faction expects at least 15,000 supporters on Sunday.\r\n?Of course Gorkhaland is still on the table. But not in the form of the agitation we have just gone through ? with innumerable sufferings for the people and violence. People were completely fed up of the indefinite strike. Even if we call a similar strike now, we would lose support,? he said.Meanwhile, in anticipation of Sunday?s public meeting, Gurung on Friday released an audio message from an undisclosed location, asking the people of the Hills to not attend the rally. Announcing that November 19 will be observed as a ?Black Day? in Darjeeling, Gurung said that ?it is a ploy? by the Mamata Banerjee-led government to show that Tamang is now the leader of the Hills and also to veer the agitation away from Gorkhaland.Reacting to Gurung?s call for a boycott of the meeting, Thapa said, ?Ab who bhi kya karega bechara. All he can do now is release these audio recordings. I believe that we have managed to capture the Hills already.?\r\nPolitical observers in the Hills, however, described the scheduled meeting as ?nothing less than a watershed moment for Darjeeling politics?.?Tomorrow?s meeting will determine the future course that the Hill politics will take. If the Tamang faction can show that it has the requisite strength and if thousands of people turn up for the meeting, then it will show that the Gurung faction is waning and that the new leadership has made inroads into Hill politics. Not just Tamang, but there will be space created for new leaders from GNLF and Jan Andolan Party,? said a political analyst in Darjeeling.The analyst added, ?There is a possibility that many will show up tomorrow despite Gurung?s warning. The 104-day strike (demanding a separate state of Gorkhaland) was a bit too much for the people to take and led to a lot of sufferings.??From what I have heard, the Tamang faction has also penetrated into Tukvar. Many GJM co-founders have switched over to the Tamang faction ? Dawa Lhama, Jyoti Rai and Diwakar Gurung ? just to name a few. There were around 90 members in GJM?s central committee and 35 have already switched over to the Tamang faction,? the analyst said.\r\nSources said that in the coming days, the Tamang faction is likely to reconstitute its central committee, inducting more members into it.',real
'A set up against a man he?d never lost to, Roger Federer looked to be cruising toward a shot at a seventh ATP Finals title. David Goffin had other ideas.The Belgian rallied in the semifinals on Saturday to claim the biggest win of his career and stun the favorite 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.?It is the best win of my career, for sure,? Goffin said.?I started to feel the ball better at the end of the first set, so I wanted to be more aggressive. It paid off. I started to serve well. My forehand was going much better.?Federer was on course to reach his 11th final at the elite season-ending tournament when he cruised through the first set, but Goffin took advantage of a drop in his play to force a third set.Despite having lost all six of his previous encounters with Federer, Goffin was able to execute better in the decider, breaking in the third game and producing a nerveless display of serving.In the final on Sunday he will face Grigor Dimitrov or Jack Sock. They play later Saturday.?I just think he raised his game,? Federer said. ?I couldn?t follow any more. Maybe my game dropped naturally a little bit because he was playing better.?Having won all three of his round-robin matches at the O2 Arena, Federer continued his fine form to break twice in the first set.However, the match turned in the second game of the second set. Federer wasted two game points on his serve before Goffin produced a forehand passing shot to take his first break point of the match.?It was a tough game to get broken at 1-0,? Federer said. ?I had I think multiple game chances to get out of the game and go 1-1, keep the pressure up. I think things really turned around for him at that moment.?The winners flowed from Goffin?s racket, unsettling Federer, who coughed up uncharacteristic errors.Goffin needed just the one break in both the second and third sets and displayed a previously unseen grit to deny Federer his lone break point opportunities in either set.The match was typical of Goffin?s inconsistent week on his full debut at the tournament, after he played one match as an alternate a year ago.After defeating a wounded Rafael Nadal in his opening match, he was thrashed in just 74 minutes by Dimitrov, before qualifying for the semis with a comfortable win over Dominic Thiem.?Both are really special,? said Goffin, after becoming only the sixth man to defeat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament. ?It was the first time against Rafa. Then the semifinal for the first time for me here, and to beat Roger for the first time here in such a big event, big tournament, it was the perfect moment.?',real
'Title: New Wealth of Nations\r\nAuthor: Surjit S Bhalla\r\nPublisher: Simon and Schuster\r\nPages: 224\r\nPrice: Rs 599The great inflation decline (GID)Today, we are back to the low inflation era of the 1950s and 1960s. For the 17 years following 1951, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in the US averaged 1.7 per cent, and the medium inflation in the AEs averaged 2.8 per cent. For the years 2000?2016, US inflation was 2.1 per cent, and in AEs, 1.9 per cent.Inflation jumped in the world in 1972 due to a wheat shortage, and the Yom Kippur war of October 1973 induced double-digit world inflation ? the first time in world history, and very likely the last time. Oil prices quadrupled in 1973 and the world experienced a phenomenon which came to be known as ?stagflation? ? a word invented to describe low output growth and high inflation, something neither the monetarists nor the Keynesians thought possible.Then came Paul Volcker who fought inflation, and won. Volcker was brought in by President Carter to head the US Fed in 1979, with the near explicit mandate to fight double-digit inflation. This, he did. In fact, he was so successful and popular that Republican President Reagan reappointed him in 1983. Volcker?s second term came to an end in August 1987. No necessary causation here, but less than two months after his leaving, the US stock market crashed by 25 per cent in one day.By 1984, OPEC inflation had run its course. From double digit inflation for most of the period from 1973 to 1983, median inflation in the advanced economies (AEs) was reduced to 6.2 per cent in 1984 and 5.7 per cent in 1985. From the early 1990s, median inflation has stayed well below 4 per cent and close to 2 per cent. This is what can be termed the ?great inflation decline? (GID), and it?s a phenomenon crying out for an explanation.Economists have tried various explanations for the GID. My favourite explanation is also a favourite among many economists, including officials of the Reserve Bank of India. The reasoning centres around a three-letter word ? oil ? as it did 45 years ago. But has oil mattered for inflation since the early 1980s? Between 1998 and 2007, oil prices quintupled (from US $14.4 for a West Texas intermediate barrel in 1998 to US $72 in 2007, before peaking at around US $160 in 2008), and inflation in the AEs and in a large number of emerging market economies was lower by half a percentage point.Today, the US economy is as close to full employment as it has ever been, and yet there is no sign of inflation. The GID has caused the central banks in the world to fight a different and unprecedented battle ? how to increase the inflation rate. Over the last few years, central banks (the Fed, ECB, and the Bank of Japan) are fighting, clamouring, plotting, and begging to get the inflation rate up to 2 per cent, and ?obviously? not succeeding. What could be the reason?The reason is that the world has changed, and the old models do not fit the facts of the new world. And the world changed more than 20 years ago. Misinterpreting this change or not acknowledging it has led central bankers to make big policy mistakes. One such prominent central banker was Alan Greenspan.How one central banker misinterpreted the great inflation declineIn February 1995, barely two months after the large Mexican currency devaluation of December 1994, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan raised interest rates in the US by a half percentage point to 6 per cent. For the uninitiated, half a per cent (50 basis points) is a very large move by the US Fed and not that usual with inflation hovering around 3 per cent.Greenspan was wrong on at least two counts. First, he could not conceive that a large Mexican devaluation of December 1994, affecting at least all of Latin America and most of the East, would or should have an impact on US inflation, and consequently on the US monetary policy and its fight to keep inflation low. Traditional monetary policy was fast declining as an instrument for attacking inflation even then.The second error of the redoubtable Greenspan was in thinking that inflation in the US was a problem. In 1994, consumer prices had increased by 2.6 per cent, having increased by a seemingly large 3 per cent the year before. What Greenspan was apparently attempting to attack was not inflation, but future impending inflation to be brought upon by the higher than inflation-neutral GDP growth in the future. That is a mouthful (my apologies) but it gets to the heart of the puzzle, and how the central bankers have adamantly refused to see the? writing on the wall. In 1994, GDP growth in the US was a high 4 per cent and Greenspan (wrongly) inferred that this high growth would induce higher inflation.It is instructive to see how un-right or un-prescient the leading central banker in the world was about future US events. In 1995, the year of the great strike against impending inflation, US GDP growth recorded 2.7 per cent, and would not record lower GDP growth until the 9?11 year. For the next five years (1996?2000), US GDP growth averaged 4.3 per cent per annum; US CPI inflation averaged 2.5 per cent per annum. During the previous decade, US GDP growth averaged 3.1 per cent, and US inflation 3.6 per cent. This was the first warning sign that ignoring higher education (skilled labour) in the developing world would lead to domestic policy mistakes.Explaining the great inflation decline: The usual suspects fail?Low inflation has been a phenomenon for the last 20 years. That is what we have to seek an explanation for. Topping the list of claimants seeking credit for low inflation, you guessed it, are central banks. These central banks are now more independent of government restraints (and constraints) than ever before, and surely this institutional change has helped decrease inflation. The number of inflation-targeting countries has also increased, and these born-again inflation hawks fight even nonexistent inflation with the tenacity of a raging bull. Hence, inflation is low because of sensible central bank policies.',real
'For the last few weeks, the social web has been preoccupied with a hashtag and a list. #MeToo has been trending in different parts of the world, as it invites people who have suffered sexual abuse and violence ? especially women ? to come out and narrate their experience to name the problem that remains a well-known secret. The hashtag is a call for action to break through the taboo of owning sexual abuse and calling out the cultures of silence that protect sexual predators and perpetrators of violence.While there have been many battle calls in the past for victims of sexual abuse to not give in to shame, the response to this hashtag appears unprecedented because of two conditions that digital networks offer. The first is the possibility of anonymity. The victims can, while remaining anonymous, still express their grief, anger, frustration and despair at continued cycles of abuse. The second is the breaking of the isolation chambers, where they no longer feel isolated but realise that they are struggling to fight a larger problem ? and that they have allies they can depend on.This digital invitation has generated an inspiring number of people ? expectedly, largely women ? who have produced the largest consolidated testimony of how everyday experiences of abuse become allowed, condoned, and even defended by institutions like families, markets and governments. The hashtag created a particular furore in India, because it elicited a militant response ? #himtoo.There was a suggestion that maybe it is also time to name the perpetrators rather than just reliving grief and facing a politics of despair. A list was curated, first on Facebook and then on an open Google document, which named some very influential names within Indian (and some global) academic institutions. Some of these names already have a history of public accusations and legal cases. Some of the names opened up a stream of accusations, which have been shored up but never released for the power that their institutional positions wield. And a few of the names were shocking because they are people who have positioned themselves as allies in the social justice movements in the country. Indeed, some of the men on the list have made professional academic careers out of their solidarity with women?s and queer rights activism.The list ? digital in nature and hence, unforgiving and unforgetting ? has performed the act of transgression that digital technologies always offered the scope of. The list isn?t just content, but a potent digital object. It connects, circulates, and finds new relationships of causality and correlation that transcend localised human networks. The list has become a space of huge contention because the digital native feminists who are using social media to find solidarity in numbers and catharsis in naming are using newer strategies. These are particularly different from the pre-digital feminist tactics, which have depended more on secret connections and expanding circles of trust. There is, in the feminist groups within the country, a lot of debate (and some hostile name-calling) for and against the list.While there is much to think about and discuss, something that strikes me is that the debates follow an expected trope in digital activism. Researchers of digitally mediated activism have long warned that digital technologies have a strange way of turning the conversations inwards. Every time there is a digital platform or technology used to effect change, more often than not, the conversations end up being about the digital and its efficacy rather than the problems that are at hand. In this case, the entire debate seems to now be focused on whether the list is valid, whether the anonymous spaces of the social web are the best space for this activism, the potential for abuse if people with false agendas infiltrate these list-making exercises, and the labour of due process that must be performed to give the list credibility. All of these are fair debates. But it?s quite telling that the energy that should have been invested in thinking about systemic injustice and structural abuse is being diverted to thinking about digital technologies, forms, and processes.There are not going to be any easy answers to the list. However, there?s something we need to remember from the history of digital activism: we can?t lose focus of what is really at stake here ? cultures of sexual violence that perpetuate themselves in silence ? and we need to stop fetishising digital objects and processes as primary objects of our obsession.',real
'Dina Wadia, the only child of Pakistan founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah, passed away at her home in New York Thursday. She was 98.She was the mother of leading Parsi businessman Nusli Wadia who heads the Wadia Group which owns Bombay Dyeing, Britannia Industries and Go Air and is often described as India?s corporate samurai for his propensity to get involved in high power corporate disputes.Jinnah?s marriage to 16-year-old Ruttie Petit at the age of 42 scandalised Bombay society in the early 20th century. Ruttie was the only daughter of Sir Dinshaw Petit, the aristocratic Parsi Baronet, whose family was one of the first to open textile mills in Bombay and was renowned for charities. The Parsi community was up in arms at the impulsive and romantic Ruttie?s elopement and conversion. She was excommunicated from the community for all practical purposes.Author Sheela Reddy, in her recent book Mr and Mrs Jinnah, writes: ?A strange flaw in Ruttie?s warm and affectionate personality was that she paid little attention to her only daughter, leaving her at home with nannies and maids.?? In fact, Ruttie?s daughter was so ignored that she was not given a proper name till she was 10. Her mother passed away in tragic circumstances at the age of 29.Dina was the product of a doomed marriage of complete opposites. Jinnah, who was almost as old as Ruttie?s father, was dour, proud, withdrawn, cautious and from a conservative Khoja Muslim family. Ruttie was pampered, impulsive, emotional, extravagant and reckless.After his wife?s death, Jinnah became increasingly orthodox and preoccupied with his mission to carve out from India a separate Muslim majority country, Pakistan. He permitted Dina?s grandmother, Dinbai Petit, to have a major say in the upbringing of his daughter and even permitted the child to take her grandmother?s name. Despite the early tragedy in her life, Dina had, according to friends, a happy childhood and a friendly, warm and kindly disposition. She was brought up in a largely Parsi milieu.Jinnah was shocked when she informed him at the age of 17 that she intended to marry Neville Wadia, the scion of an equally illustrious Parsi family in the textile business. According to Jinnah?s one-time junior, the late Justice Mahommed Currim Chagla, Jinnah scolded his daughter and told her that there were millions of Muslim boys in India and she could have anyone she chose. Dina, who was more than a match for her father, replied, ?Father, there were millions of Muslim girls in India. Why did you not marry one of them???For Jinnah, the marriage was a major political embarrassment. He became permanently estranged from his daughter and her family. Before leaving for the soon-to-be-formed Pakistan, he met his daughter for the last time along with her son Nusli and her daughter Diana. Dina made a trip to Pakistan in 2003, the first time since his funeral, to visit her father?s grave along with her son and two grandsons, Ness and Jeh. It came as a shock to most Pakistanis to discover that the descendants of the Quaid-e-Azam were in fact Parsis living in India, since it was kept a closely guarded secret by the Pakistani authorities for many years.In her later years, Dina lived mostly in New York though she made an annual trip to Mumbai to meet her family and friends. She was extremely close to son Nusli who visited her often.Incidentally, Dina was fighting a suit in court to claim legal possession of South Court on Malabar Hill, now usually referred to as Jinnah House. Valued at over $400 million, the stately bungalow, badly in need of repairs, has historical significance for the sub-continent since Jinnah, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi met there before the formation of Pakistan.',real

'Ever since I maligned them terribly in one of my books (The Tigers of Taboo Valley) by casting them as villainous terrorists out to exterminate tigers, I?ve felt a bit bad about it, and apologise for hurting any prickly sentiments. But to make up, somewhat, I did give them sweet names such as Col. ?Cuddles? Khujlimal ? he was an Indian crested porcupine, leader of the dreaded Al Seekh Kebab Atankvaad Andolan.You may cuddle porcupines at your own risk, but tigers, leopards, wolves and hyenas are amongst their number one enemies for one reason: they like eating them. Porcupines protect themselves from becoming dinner by reversing at full speed into the faces of their attackers ? sometimes blinding and laming them. Occasionally, porcupines injure them so badly that all they can hunt thereafter are humans ? the easiest prey to kill. Thus are born some terrible pain-crazed man-eaters.However, let?s get one thing straight: porcupines (even American ones, which may be armed with up to 30,000 quills) do not shoot their quills at their victims. Porcupines just back into their victims/enemies at top speed, impaling them with dreadfully barbed quills and take off after. The quills stick inside their victims, turning them into pincushions as the porcupine scoots. There?s one more thing in the rodent?s defence: they first give fair warning about what?s to come. Long quills (brown or black, usually 30 cm long) on the neck and shoulder are attached to muscles under the skin, and become erect when a threat looms, to make the porcupine look larger and scarier. Hollow, whitish quills at the base of the tail are rattled as a warning: so the porcupine gives you both a visual and an aural warning (it also growls and grunts) before attacking. The back and rump are equipped with stabbing quills which do the damage. Quills, which are made of keratin, are modified hairs. They are soft and pliable at the time of birth, so as not to add to the agony of the mother?s labour pains. But they harden soon after birth.Porcupines, which are rodents ? the third largest after the capybara and the beaver ? are found nearly all over the world. The Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix indica) is a heavily built (18 kg), ponderous, rather myopic, nocturnal creature that needs to forage seven hours a night on roots, tubers, vegetable matter, fruit, small insects and vertebrates, augmenting its calcium and mineral intake (to strengthen its quills) by chewing on small bones. Armed with sharp chisel-like incisors, broad feet and long claws, it can play havoc in farmers? fields with its heavy duty JCB-like nocturnal excavations. But it does spread seeds and pollen too, balancing things out somewhat. It is easy to hunt and is killed for its meat and quills, which are put to various uses, from mumbo-jumbo medicinal concoctions to hair accessories. Though not officially endangered, and of ?least concern?, it is said that porcupine numbers are declining by as much as 10 per cent per year, and annual tribal hunts (in places like Assam) account for hundreds of victims.',real
'Paris St Germain?s unstoppable march towards the Ligue 1 title continued when Edinson Cavani?s double inspired them to a 4-1 home win against Nantes on Saturday.Cavani netted either side of half-time as Javier Pastore and Angel Di Maria also scored to put the unbeaten capital side on 35 points from 13 games, six ahead of second-placed Monaco after the champions were held to a 1-1 at Amiens on Friday.Nantes, who are fifth on 23 points, scored through Prejuce Nakoulma as Claudio Ranieri?s team faltered under pressure.

'Book-The Book of Dust Volume 1: La Belle Sauvage\r\nAuthor-Philip Pullman\r\nPublication-David Fickling Books \r\nPages-624\r\nPrice- Rs 599As epic endings go, the final pages of?The Amber Spyglass ? the last of Philip Pullman?s His Dark Materials trilogy ? are difficult to surpass. Lyra Silvertongue and Will Parry put an end to God, a mundane desert that is the afterlife, fall in love to save the multiverse and must live apart for the same reasons. Paradise was lost in Pullman?s fantasy world, and that was welcome, because paradise is a dangerous lie as are the churches that promise it. For those who read His Dark Materials as children (and likely re-read it as adults),?La Belle Sauvage is another chance to enter a world where a repressive church and state try to control diversity, sexuality and knowledge.But while Northern Lights (the first part of the original trilogy) began in a baroque Oxford in a parallel universe, La Belle Sauvage is set in the countryside about a decade before the events in the previous trilogy. Malcolm Polstead, the protagonist, (quite unlike Lyra) is the ideal boy: His parents run a pub in Oxford, he loves his canoe ? the La Belle Sauvage, is curious about literature and science and is quite the handyman.Malcom gradually gets involved with an anti-Church espionage unit through Dr Hannah Relf and with Lyra, a baby that is the product of scandal and intrigue in the highest political circles. The spectre of Dust ? an elementary particle that disproves the idea of soul/spirit ? haunts the book. We learn more about characters from the original trilogy and exactly how Lyra came to be raised at Jordan college in Oxford, her parents? separation and the political rivalries that define her world, the nature of the alethiometer ? a truth-telling device that operates through Dust. Figures like Farder Coram, wise and decrepit in the original, are seen in their prime as spies. Pullman?s affinity for biblical metaphors makes itself felt through the second half of the book. The La Belle Sauvage turns into Noah?s Ark and Malcolm and Alice (a working-class girl who turns a friend) try to get Lyra to safety through a flood of magical and mythical proportions.The plot and pace of?La Belle Sauvage?pale in comparison to Northern Lights. As a hero, Malcolm is simply too white-bread, although there are portends of the character going down dark, complex paths in the future. The book feels like a long setup to the sequel, which one hopes will move a little faster, go a little deeper. There is also the fact that for those who haven?t read His Dark Materials, much of the context of La Belle Sauvage will be difficult to decipher. Simply put, Pullman needed a better editor. But what makes The Book of Dust worth reading, especially for young people, is that Pullman has lost none of his courage when it comes to dealing with sexuality and how politics and religion seek to control it.In Pullman?s world, personhood is divided in two ? the human form and an animal (ever-changing for children and fixed post-puberty). People?s ?daemons? represent their sentience and sexuality, which are in some ways for all of us, inextricably linked. The villain in La Belle Sauvage, for example, is a manipulator and abuser of children. He hates his hyena-daemon and abuses and beats her mercilessly.With remarkable subtlety and skill, Pullman manages to convey the nervous excitement of receiving sexual attention from a practised predator, especially when one is ignorant of the ways of such people, and the wave of queasiness that comes when we realise what happened, what was at stake. He explores the cruelty of children, the wilderness that is adolescence without knowledge, safety and friendship and does so with honesty. Two-thirds through the book, in a moment of anger and vulnerability, Alice uses a barrage of f-words. It displays her weakness, her rage and Pullman has the sense to know that his young readers need not be shielded from that. That in the correct context, teenage readers can make sense of most things.Pullman has matured in his understanding of religion since His Dark Materials as well. He has moved from a Richard Dawkins-like dismissal of religion to a more nuanced take. While the church-state is still the villain, a priory run by kind, accepting nuns also finds pride of place in La Belle Sauvage. Pullman shows how religion is a refuge for those defeated by life, that piety need not make one conservative and controlling.',real
'Crystal Palace was denied a crucial English Premier League victory after a controversial penalty earned Everton a 2-2 draw on Saturday.Roy Hodgson?s Palace twice took the lead at Selhurst Park with goals from James McArthur and Wilfried Zaha, but the hosts were frustrated when they felt Oumar Niasse dived to earn a penalty and then scored Everton?s second goal by halftime.(English Premier League Home | Fixtures | Standings/Table)The visitors showed little, beyond resilience, to strengthen caretaker manager David Unsworth?s bid to be appointed on a permanent basis amid the expectation Everton will again approach Watford for Marco Silva in the coming week.For last-place Palace, a wider concern will be dropping two further points after again impressing. Everton is 16th in the 20-team standings.Burnley sink Swansea to make it three in a rowSean Dyche?s Burnley continued their excellent campaign with a 2-0 win over struggling Swansea City at Turf Moor on Saturday to stay in seventh place.Jack Cork, fresh from winning his first England cap, put Burnley ahead in the 29th minute when he burst from midfield and then got on the end of a Robbie Brady cross with a well-placed header.The Clarets doubled their advantage five minutes before the break when Jeff Hendrick found Ashley Barnes and the striker, selected ahead of Sam Vokes, blasted home from the edge of the area.The result means Burnley have three straight victories in the top flight for the first time since the 1974-75 season and leaves Swansea next to the bottom on eight points.Callum Wilson nets impressive hat-trick for BournemouthCallum Wilson put his injury torment behind him as he netted an impressive hat-trick to help Bournemouth record a 4-0 victory over Huddersfield Town at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday.Wilson has been forced to miss a large part of 2017 with a serious knee injury but opened the scoring on 26 minutes when he headed home a corner from Jordan Ibe and doubled the lead five minutes later when he broke the offside trap and delivered a fine finish past Huddersfield keeper Jonas Lossl.The home side were reduced to ten men on the stroke of halftime when Simon Francis picked up his second yellow card of the game but made it three on 70 minutes when Harry Arter made no mistake with a clinical finish just inside the area.',real
'Book- Barefoot to boots: The many lives of Indian football\r\nAuthor- Novy Kapadia\r\nPublisher- Penguin\r\nPages- 345?\r\nPrice- 399Hyderabad has unearthed some of Indian football?s biggest superstars. But its contribution goes way beyond the football field. If not for a local team from the city, Delhi?s most famous eating joint might never have been discovered.Football expert Novy Kapadia?s latest book, Barefoot to boots: Many Lives of Indian Football, is an eye-opener is many ways. But it also surprises you with tales beyond the football pitch, underlining the cultural influence the sport had before it went into a freefall.Back in the day, Karim?s was just another restaurant in Old Delhi that served Mughlai food and provided cheap, basic accommodation for those who couldn?t afford a more luxurious stay in the capital ? until it was made famous by Hyderabad City Police, the erstwhile heavyweights of Indian football.Since 1950, when they were in Delhi for the Durand Cup, the team?s players stayed at the Karim Hotel due to its proximity to the Jama Masjid. The fans flocked to interact with their heroes and while waiting for them, they would order food from the restaurant. ?The reputation of its mouth-watering dishes spread far and wide by word of mouth? Creditably, the owners of Karim Hotel acknowledge the role played by the Hyderabad City Police football team in popularising their restaurant,? Kapadia writes, adding that the former players of the team get 50 per cent discount even today.As former India captain Baichung Bhutia says in his foreword, Kapadia is ?the grand old man of Indian football?. As a fan, journalist and commentator, he has followed the sport for close to 60 years, writing for multiple newspapers and appearing on television channels as an expert. He belongs to the rare breed of followers who can remember the right back from India?s 1962 Asian Games squad and even the wingers from Bengaluru FC?s AFC Cup final last year.Kapadia has experienced first-hand the heady days of the country?s dominance in Asia to the current dismal state where they struggle to qualify for the continental championships. But this book isn?t a rant. Instead, it transports you back to a time in Indian football where the players were treasured and there was genuine passion for the local game. It drips with nostalgia, reminiscing about famous players, matches and tournaments but also takes a pragmatic look at the current state of affairs.My first meeting with Kapadia was on the upper tier of the Ambedkar Stadium where he sat under the harsh summer sun commentating on an under-16 boy?s match. Even today, Ambedkar ? earlier called the Delhi Gate Stadium ? has an old-world charm to it, which Kapadia beautifully captures in his chapter on the capital, once the hub of national football.Kapadia recalls the celebrations that followed City Club?s remarkable victory over Indian Nationals in the Old Delhi derby of July 1964. City Club?s main man, Aziz Qureishi, ?was given free glasses of milk by happy supporters for the rest of the year; for a fortnight after the match the team was invited for sumptuous daawats by delirious fans.?There are personal stories of Kapadia attending Mohun Bagan?s Durand Cup quarterfinal against Bangalore?s Chief of Inspectorate Lines in 1965, hours after the death of his grandmother. Kapadia snuck out without informing anyone, but when the family got to know he had skipped the funeral for the match, his father, uncle and even the priest were curious to know if Bagan had won.Through the 345 pages, Kapadia marvels and mourns the rise and fall of the sport in traditional pockets such as Goa and Kerala through a series of anecdotes. But at the same time, this isn?t just a recollection about the good old days.Indian football is going through an identity crisis like never before. The brash, in-your-face Indian Super League (ISL) has shaken the old, established order and created what AIFF president Praful Patel called a ?disruption? that has left the country without a proper domestic league.The ISL, de facto first division, kicked off on Friday without East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, who will continue to play in the I-League, the federation-organised league that is kicked into oblivion. Kapadia warns it would be ?a catastrophe if these two clubs and therefore this derby match declines?Indian football with a downgraded or non-existent East Bengal or Mohun Bagan would be like Agra without the Taj Mahal.?Such warnings, alas, have fallen on deaf ears. In the last few years, hundreds of players lost employment as the clubs stopped competing in major tournaments such as the Durand Cup while the once-glamorous Santosh Trophy has lost its relevance. And, even though the national team is steadily rising in international rankings, India?s dream to reclaim its lost continental glory remains just that ? a dream.',real

'Ever since Hindutva spread like a saffron skein across our ancient land, a new kind of chippy Indian has emerged. The chip on his shoulder is so huge that the smallest criticism of Hinduism, Hindus or Hindustan sends him (and her) into an apoplectic fit, especially on Twitter. The rage vented is so petty, putrid and pathetic that I believe that instead of being the proud patriots these chippy Indians profess to be, they are secretly ashamed of being Indian. I find myself permanently at war with these ?Hindu nationalists?, so I warn you in advance that I absolutely refuse to be counted among them when you finish reading this piece.I belong to an older, more confident genre of Indians. We never needed to wear nationalism or faith as shining cloaks of our identity because we knew who we were and were proud of it. The India I grew up in had more Indians of my kind than of the new kind, and rarely did they become enraged by what foreign newspapers wrote about India. On a personal level, I discovered from more than a decade of writing for a foreign newspaper that the levels of ignorance among my British colleagues were so deep, there was no point in arguing with them. The India they were interested in belonged in books they may have read in school?snake charmers, starving millions, Mowgli and tigers.So I could sell them a story on the Dom Raja of Benares any time, but when I suggested that I go to Ayodhya, when the forces of Hindutva gathered there to tear down the Babri Masjid, the foreign editor did not think it was an important story. Another example of dazzling ignorance was when he insisted that it was impossible for ?someone as good looking as Rajiv Gandhi to lose the election (in 1989) to a funny little man in a funny cap?. I tried to explain that looks mattered less in India than in sophisticated western democracies but it was useless.So I learned long ago that the people who wrote about India in foreign newspapers were nearly all too ignorant to argue with. This week if I take issue with the absurd New York Times article on Hindutva and the sari, it is because the article seems to have been written by an Indian and because this newspaper is too important to ignore. I take issue also because nearly every political story I have read in the The New York Times in recent years has been based on prejudice and ignorance. Anyone who can write, as the writer did last week in ?Politics, India style?, that Har Har Mahadev means everyone is Lord Shiva, needs to never write another word about India as long as he lives. But, it is exactly this kind of ignorance that finds its way into almost any political article that The New York Times publishes on India.At the risk of sounding a little like a chippy, Hindutva type, I have to point out that there has been much more ignorance and prejudice about India evident in The New York Times since Narendra Modi became prime minister. The best example of this prejudice is that he is often made to sound as if he were the only chief minister who presided over communal riots in which the victims were mostly Muslim. In older times, it was hard to remember the exact number of times in which horrible riots have occurred in India since 1947. Now all you need is Google to get a detailed list, and yet this myth continues to be perpetuated by a newspaper that is today possibly the most important in the world.',real
'While a good education abroad works wonders for an individual?s career prospects, it also ends up burning a large hole in their pocket. It is not always easy to ask for money back home from your parents, yet the experience of living with a low supply of funds can be excruciating.In such a scenario, looking for part-time jobs can emerge as the ideal choice, as it reduces the excess burden on parents while inculcating a sense of responsibility and discipline in students and providing them with a chance to gather some unique experiences.Enlisted below are a few part-time jobs that are suitable for Indian students looking to substantiate their financial resources while simultaneously pursuing their studies:1. Canada According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) department?s latest ruling, an international student is now allowed to work off-campus without a work permit if they are full-time students with a valid study permit and pursuing a course that will continue for at least six months, earning them a degree, diploma or a certificate.\r\nStudents can work as interns or research scholars in their area of academics or as servers in restaurants, consumer representatives, garage workers etc up to 20 hours per week.2. New Zealand One of the most beautiful places in the world, New Zealand has consistently ranked in the top 20 in terms of the quality of education provided in the island country. New Zealand was among the first few countries to implement a ?code of practice? for institutions admitting foreign students. International students on a hired visa are allowed to work part-time for up to 20 hours a week during classes and full-time on scheduled holidays. Data-entry work, translation assignments, interlocutors, attendants in super-markets, lab help are some of the popular part-time job options for students in New Zealand.3. United States of America Twenty hours per week is the cap on any on-campus part-time job undertaken by an international student. The visa guidelines specify that international students cannot work off-campus, but that should not be considered a hindrance as the campus offers plenty of options.\r\nFrom library monitors, research assistants, cr?che handlers for children of the staff to peer tutors or bookstore assistants, campuses offer a variety of jobs that pay a decent wage while keeping the student near his/her place of residence.4. Australia International students are allowed to work 40 hours per fortnight on their student visa in Australia, while during semester breaks a person is allowed to work unlimited hours. Here the work is available in a variety of areas such as retail, hospitality, services, industry, it is important for students to open an Australian bank account and apply for a tax file number to ensure that they are taxed at the correct rate. This also helps and develop a propensity to save.5. The United Kingdom Indian students studying in the UK are allowed to work for up to 20 hours per week during a study-term. During vacation period, they are allowed to work full-time. However, students who are pursuing any course less than six months in duration are not allowed to work in the UK in most cases. Online portals are a very popular option for securing part-time work in the UK and most Indian and international students enlist on a variety of portals to allow them to find a job that matches their field of study.Being a restaurant staff is also a popular option as London is filled with restaurants serving Indian and a host of cuisines from multiple countries. Working in these establishments guarantees a student a free meal in the evenings apart from substantial savings.',real
'La Liga leaders Barcelona will be short of options in defence for next Sunday?s top-of-the-table clash with Valencia after Gerard Pique was suspended for the game by picking up a fifth booking of the season against Leganes on Saturday.Pique?s absence comes after Argentina international Javier Mascherano was ruled out for a month with a muscle injury, leaving coach Ernesto Valverde with only two defenders for the crucial trip to the Mestalla in Samuel Umtiti and Thomas Vermaelen.Injury-prone Belgium defender Vermaelen, 32, has not played a minute of action for Barca this season and has only been named as a substitute in three games. He has, however, played five of Belgium?s last six internationals, starting their recent friendlies against Mexico and Japan.Barcelona beat Leganes 3-0 with a double from Luis Suarez and an injury time strike from Paulinho to move seven points clear of Valencia, who can reduce the deficit back to four when they visit Espanyol on Sunday.',real

'Moving away from old trends, young women are now opting for preservative-free products for a long-lasting glow and balanced health ahead of their wedding day. The Indian wedding sector is reportedly estimated to be around $40-50 billion in size. So, it turns out to be an important market for many brands. Sheena Jain, founder of India?s first fresh almond milk brand SAIN, says the uptrend of going organic and vegan is more likely a result of current health and wellness trends which are fast catching up with women in the age group of 18 to 40. ?Weddings are huge in India and every bride wants to achieve the right balance of internal and external beauty. Pre-bridal detox is a huge trend overseas and now it?s fast catching up in India. The consumer rates back-to-basics food attributes like ?all natural?, ?no artificial colours or flavours? and ?plant-based? as the most important,? Jain told IANS.Almond milk is one of the food items that can help people maintain natural glow as it is a good source of Vitamin E, an antioxidant which has natural skin healing properties. Chef Swasti Aggarwal, Food Strategies at Foodhall, says eating organic and vegan is a huge trend in the market and a lot of brides are doing detox diets to look good and glow on their D-day. ?Veganism is great as it provides all the nutrition we need with plant sources and avoids the intake of excess fat and protein that meat gives,? Aggarwal told IANS of the diet, which excludes meat, eggs, dairy products and all other animal-derived ingredients.She said the impact is great if the diet becomes a lifestyle and people eat healthy for life.Supriya Chopra, Founder, The Salad Story, is equally excited about the trend.?I think eating healthy is a huge fad in the market and a lot of brides and their families are doing detox diets for the glow and to look the best and attractive on their big day. For instance, we offer a complete, healthy package of fresh vegetables, variety of leaves and right proteins to fulfill your intake of important vitamins and minerals,? Chopra told IANS.She also said that eating fresh and healthy is expensive, and preparation is not easy ? with ingredients like balsamic vinaigrette, honey, olive oil, yogurt, feta cheese and berries. ?But it?s always better to invest in right and balanced eating than spend later on some lifestyle disease,? said Chopra. Brides-to-be also have no qualms in opting for extreme vegan and organic diets for best results.',real
'Euphoric crowds of several thousand people have gathered in Zimbabwe?s capital to demand the departure of President Robert Mugabe after nearly four decades in power. In a colorful gathering that even days ago would have drawn an immediate police crackdown, Zimbabweans giddy with joy raced through intersections, raising their arms in triumph. Young men shouted, laughed and embraced.Some had posters with an image of the military commander who swept in earlier this week and put Mugabe under house arrest, with the slogan: ?Go, go, our general!!!? Marchers handed flags to soldiers, who accepted and waved.?It?s like Christmas,? said one marcher, Fred Mubay, who said Zimbabweans have been suffering for a long time.The 93-year-old Mugabe, the world?s oldest head of state, is said to be asking for more time amid negotiations with regional leaders that seek his exit with a veneer of dignity.But he is virtually powerless and deserted by most of his allies, with others arrested, and the crowds in Harare on Saturday were making it clear the country was impatient to move on without him.Even as concerns remained about who next would be in charge and what freedoms might be available if the military lingered in power _ or if Mugabe?s longtime but recently fired deputy led a new government _ people reveled in the rare chance to speak out.The demonstrators, in the event approved by the military, hope a big turnout will speed up the official end of Mugabe?s rule, which is widely blamed for the collapse of an economy that was once one of Africa?s wealthiest.Veterans of the long liberation war against white minority rule, once close allies of Mugabe, took part, along with opposition activists who have faced police crackdowns by the Mugabe government.At an intersection, a vendor held up a newspaper with the headline: ?Mugabe cornered.?One driver was so jubilant that he got out of his moving car and danced in front of it for a couple of minutes as the empty vehicle coasted slowly down a street lined with cheering crowds.Some white Zimbabweans joined the crowd at Harare?s Freedom Square, also known as Robert Mugabe Square. Some whites and blacks hugged each other.Soldiers began approaching the demonstrators and urging them to head to the Zimbabwe Grounds, where speeches were set to be delivered.The Zimbabwe Grounds were chosen for the symbolism. The location is where Zimbabweans gathered to cheer Mugabe?s return from exile in 1980 after the liberation war from white minority rule.Now the crowds wish to meet there and urge Mugabe?s departure.The 37-year-old Talent Mudzamiri was born soon after Zimbabwe?s independence.?It?s like a relief,? he said. ?Our voices have not been heard for a long time. The trend in Africa, when the people speak, they are not heard.?',real

'Storming into a huge gathering at Mansa, in Gandhinagar district, Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel on Saturday evening took the attack to the ruling BJP, blaming the party of trying to weaken the Patidar agitation. Mansa is the hometown of BJP president Amit Shah.On Saturday, Patel was first given permission to hold a meeting, and then denied it. The district authorities eventually allowed him to hold the meeting. Daring the ruling party, Hardik said, ?You want to fight us (Patidar movement)? Then there are two ways: fight us legally, or if you want to do goondagardi, we are ready for that, too.??We need to write on our foreheads, hun Gujarati pan murkh chu (I am a Gujarati but I am a fool),? he said, mocking the BJP campaign slogan ?hu chhu vikas hun chhu Gujarat (I am vikas, I am Gujarat)?. While the BJP Saturday announced that three more members of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) have joined the party, including Ketan Patel, who had turned approver in the case against Hardik, the PAAS convenor said, ?What do you mean, saying PAAS members have joined the BJP? Bhai, is the election between the BJP and Congress, or between BJP and PAAS??While Hardik told the crowd that if the BJP wins ?it will mean 6 crore people (of Gujarat) are defeated?, he did not once ask people to help, or vote for, the Congress. Once elected, he alleged, MLAs either get government plots in state capital Gandhinagar or sell themselves for crores against casting their votes.Calling it a fight for ?self-respect?, Hardik, referring to the recent video that surfaced online, purportedly showing him with a woman in a hotel room, said, ?Gujarat?s people want to see CDs of vikas (development), not of a young boy..

The MLA had openly supported the Patidar agitation and exhorted the community to defeat BJP in the 2015 local body elections. Later, he toed the BJP line. On Friday, Kotadiya released a video statement saying he had decided not to contest the Assembly election this year, and that he had not sought ticket for any seat.Twenty-eight candidates were announced for the second phase of polling on December 14, even as severe infighting surfaced as soon as the list was made public on Friday. The party gave tickets to all five opposition MLAs who joined the BJP in the run-up to the high-pitch Rajya Sabha elections in August ? five of the Congress and one from JD(U). Senior leaders, the five hold influence in their respective constituencies.The BJP also announced candidates for the districts of Patan and Banaskantha, which were severely affected by floods in July. They go to the polls in the second phase.Of nine seats in Banaskantha, BJP had won three in 2012; the remaining six are with the Congress.

'The BJP?s second list of 36 candidates focuses on winnability, repeating 10 candidates from last Assembly elections, and three ministers, even as it dropped Minister for Women and Child Welfare Nirmala Wadhwani, who represented Naroda constituency, which goes to the polls in the second phase of Vidhan Sabha elections on December 14.The party picked Balram Thavani, a corporator from Kubernagar in Ahmedabad in 2002-05 and a loyalist of former state minister Maya Kodnani, who has been convicted in the 2002 Naroda Patia riots case, for the Naroda seat.Eighteen of 36 candidates announced will contest in the first phase.

'In a jolt to the ruling BJP in the poll-bound Gujarat, its MLA from Kodinar seat, Jetha Solanki, today quit the party and resigned from all posts, alleging that Dalits have been facing ?atrocities? under its rule.Solanki, who was one of the parliamentary secretaries appointed by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, resigned from the post. Parliamentary secretaries are considered equivalent to deputy ministers and are supposed to help the ministers.The Dalit leader also said that he was ?unhappy? after being told by the party that he will not get a ticket this time.?I have resigned from the BJP, as an MLA and also as the parliamentary secretary. I have decided to quit as the party has stopped listening to my representations,? he said.Solanki said the party conveyed to him that he would not be given a ticket this time. ?Yes, the party told me that it would not give a ticket to me this time,? he said.??The party tried to convince me not to resign but I have decided not to take back my resignation,? he said.Referring to Una Dalit atrocities case, Solanki said, ?Under this BJP government, the Dalit community has faced numerous atrocities. The community is facing a difficult situation.??During the Una incident, the Anandiben Patel government earlier took some steps, but after Vijay Rupani became the chief minister, his government has not taken any steps for upliftment of Dalits,? Solanki said.He refused to answer whether he would fight the polls as an independent candidate or join any other party. Nobody from the BJP commented on Solanki?s resignation.The BJP yesterday released its first list of 70 candidates for the Assembly elections in Gujarat next month.The BJP is yet to declare its candidate for the Kodinar seat, where elections will be held in the first phase on December 9, and the last date of filing of nomination forms is November 21.Meanwhile, supporters of senior leader I K Jadeja created ruckus at the state BJP headquarters in Gandhinagar as he was not given a ticket from Wadhwan seat.',real
'Haiti?s president on Saturday heralded the re-establishment of the country?s military after 22 years, a divisive issue in the impoverished Caribbean nation which has a history of bloody coups and political instability.Haiti has been without military forces since 1995, when former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army after returning to power following a coup, leaving the national police responsible for security.The army?s comeback has been a divisive topic in a country still suffering from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years, with critics and activists concerned that armed forces would meddle in politics and rob essential resources from education and health care.Haitian President Jovenel Moise on Thursday named former army colonel Jodel Lesage as acting commander-in-chief, moving troops closer to full operation. The appointment still needs to be approved by Haiti?s senate.On Saturday, Moise welcomed the army?s anticipated return with a parade featuring dozens of camouflaged soldiers toting rifles in the northern coastal city of Cap-Haitien, calling on Haitians to recall the Battle of Vertieres won against French colonialists exactly 214 years ago.?The army is our mother,? he said. ?When your mother is sick and wears dirty clothes, you do not kill her. You take her to the hospital. So let us join forces to provide needed care to our mother.?After Haiti?s independence, the military mounted dozens of coups and its forces were accused of rampant human rights abuses.Moise acknowledged that history, but vowed that the new military would be different.The United Nations has called for increased support for the Haitian National Police (HNP) with about 15,000 members.A U.N.-backed mission to aid Haiti?s justice system and law enforcement arrived in October, replacing a much larger peacekeeping mission that had focused on stability efforts since 2004.?Having demonstrated its ability to maintain stability and guard against security threats, the HNP has emerged as one of the most trusted governmental institutions in Haiti,?

'Independent India?s first voter, Shyam Saran Negi (101), kept his date with the elections this time too and cast his vote at Kalpa, where he received a special welcome at the booth. For years, Negi has been hailed as an example of keeping the democratic spirit alive in the mountains, especially high altitude valleys, by religiously turning up to vote in every election.?Maine apna farz nibhaya (I performed my duty),? he said as he walked out of the polling booth with help of officials of the district administration.?(PM Narendra) Modi accha aadmi hai, woh desh-hit ki baat karta hai..(Modi is a good person, he speaks for the country?s betterment),? he said.Negi has not skipped voting in a single election since October 25, 1951 ? the day on which he became the first person to vote in Independent India?s first general election.

'CENTRAL BOARD of Film Certification chairman Prasoon Joshi said on Saturday that the CBFC sent back the movie Padmavati to the filmmakers without certification because it did not contain a disclaimer specifying whether it was a work of fiction or a historical.Joshi also hit out at the fimmakers for holding a preview screening without obtaining a CBFC certification. ?In this specific case, the film?s application only came up this week for review. The makers know and admit that the paperwork is not complete. The very disclaimer, whether the film is a work of fiction or a historical, was left blank and not stated. On simply and legitimately being asked to provide important documents, they have targeted the CBFC for the delay. This is truly surprising,? said Joshi.The film, directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali with Deepika Padukone in the title role, is scheduled to release on December 1. The movie has faced widespread protests by the Karni Sena in Rajasthan over ?distortion of historical facts?, and the UP government has asked the I&B Ministry to defer its release to prevent an ?adverse effect? on the law and order situation in the state.Responding to reports of a preview screening, Joshi said, ?It?s disappointing that the film Padmavati is being screened for the media and getting reviewed on national channels without the CBFC having seen or certified the film. This compromises the role of systems and balances that are part of a functioning industry.?Joshi said it was ?myopic? to treat the official certification process ?haphazardly to suit one?s convenience?. ?On one hand, holding the CBFC responsible and pressurising to accelerate the process and, on the other hand, attempting to subvert the very process, sets an opportunistic precedent? The CBFC is a responsible body and has the best interests of the industry and society. Let?s not let convenient and casual methods be brought into the practice. We must all have a responsible, mutually respectful and balanced approach,? he said.Vivek Agnihotri, film director and CBFC member, said, ?We (the CBFC) haven?t denied anything. Every film has to go through due process for certification. The producers had sent us the script of the film. But each film has to have a disclaimer in the beginning, which cites whether the film is based on true events, is a work of fiction or is inspired. The script did not have that. They need to complete the paperwork, that?s all.?Describing the certification process, Agnihotri said, ?It?s a computer-based algorithm, which is similar to that of a passport form or Aadhaar card? if your paperwork is incomplete, they reject your application. They have to send a complete thing, and once everything is in place, we shall view it like any other film.?Agnihotri said that ?people need to stop giving into the demands of those who hold the film fraternity to ransom?. ?The industry is equally to be blamed. Every time, somebody armtwists you, we succumb to their demands. At the time of Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, I had said that Karan Johar should not have apologised. As a film fraternity, we should have taken a stand and not released any film till this phenomenon stops,? he said.',real
'If someone thanks you ?soooo? much on WhatsApp, there is no reason to mark it as a sloppy message. New research has found that ?textisms? ? emoticons, irregular spellings and exclamation points in text messages ? help convey meaning and intent in the absence of spoken conversation.?Textisms? is not a sign that written language is going down the tubes, according to the study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior.?In contrast with face-to-face conversation, texters can?t rely on extra-linguistic cues such as tone of voice and pauses, or non-linguistic cues such as facial expressions and hand gestures,? said Celia Klin, Professor at Binghamton University, State University of New York.?In a spoken conversation, the cues aren?t simply add-ons to our words; they convey critical information. A facial expression or a rise in the pitch of our voices can entirely change the meaning of our words,? Klin pointed out.It has been suggested that one way to add meaning to the words in text messages is by using ?textisms?? things like emoticons, irregular spellings (sooooo) and irregular use of punctuation (!!!), Klin said.A 2016 study led by Klin found that text messages that end with a period are seen as less sincere than text messages that do not end with a period.Klin pursued this subject further, conducting experiments to see if people reading texts understand textisms, asking how people?s understanding of a single-word text ( such as yeah, nope, maybe) as a response to an invitation is influenced by the inclusion, or absence, of a period.?In formal writing, such as what you?d find in a novel or an essay, the period is almost always used grammatically to indicate that a sentence is complete. With texts, we found that the period can also be used rhetorically to add meaning,? said Klin.The study concluded that although periods no doubt can serve a grammatical function in texts just as they can with more formal writing ? for example, when a period is at the end of a sentence ? periods can also serve as textisms, changing the meaning of the text.The researchers believe that with electronic communication, scientists can observe language evolving in real time.?What we are seeing with electronic communication is that, as with any unmet language need, new language constructions are emerging to fill the gap between what people want to express and what they are able to express with the tools they have available to them,? said Klin.?The findings indicate that our understanding of written language varies across contexts. We read text messages in a slightly different way than we read a novel or an essay. Further, all the elements of our texts ? the punctuation we choose, the way that words are spelled, a smiley face ? can change the meaning,? Klin said.',real

While it is necessary to work hard and prepare diligently, it is also important to prepare smartly. One should keep in mind that exams such as IBPS clerk do not require a person to score 100 per cent marks to succeed. In fact, all that one needs to do is to clear the cut-offs and maximise their scores.In this post, we bring to you an analysis of previous year?s cut-offs of the IBPS Clerk examination in order to help you prepare more efficiently.IBPS clerk cut-offs: 2016 prelims and mainsPlease note that these?cut-offs will be applied in two stages:(i) Sectional cut-offs: These are the marks a candidate needs to score in each section in order to qualify.(ii)?Overall cut-offs: The overall or category-wise cut-offs are the qualifying marks a candidate has to score in order to be eligible for the subsequent stage. The overall cut-offs are different for each category (general, SC, ST, OBC, PWD etc).Apart from these, the IBPS also releases?state-wise cut-off marks.?These vary as per the state a candidate has applied from. The state-wise cut-off is different for each state and can be higher or lower than the overall cut-off range.IBPS Clerk ? 2016: Sectional cut-off marks for the prelims1 Numerical Ability 10.75 for general category, 6.75 for OBC, 6.75 for SC and 6.75 for ST\r\n2 Reasoning Ability 10.25 for general category, 5.75 for OBC, 5.75 for SC and 5.75 for ST\r\n3 English Language 7.75 for general category, 4.25 for OBC, 4.25?for SC and 4.25?for ST*Note that these may vary from state to state.State-wise overall cut-offs for IBPS Clerk Prelims 2016?Andhra Pradesh 73 for general category and 73 for OBC\r\nBihar 67.5 for general category and 67.5 for OBC\r\nChandigarh 61.5 for general category\r\nChhattisgarh 63.75? for general category\r\nDelhi 67.25 ?for general category and 61.75 for OBC\r\nGujarat 58.75 for general category\r\nHaryana 68 61.5?for general category\r\nHimachal Pradesh 66.5\r\nJ&K 68.75\r\nJharkhand 70.75\r\nKarnataka 58.25 for general category and 53.75 for SC\r\nKerala 71\r\nMadhya Pradesh 65.75 for general category, 67.5 for OBC and 41.5 for ST\r\nMaharashtra 59.25?for general category, 59.25 for OBC\r\nMeghalaya 65.75 for general category\r\nOrissa 70.75 for general category\r\nPunjab 66.5 for general category\r\nRajasthan 66.75 for general category\r\nTamil Nadu 58?for general category and 58 for OBC\r\nTelangana? 65\r\nUttar Pradesh 67.75 for general category and 63.75? for OBC\r\nUttarakhand 71.25\r\nWest Bengal 70.5Go through the following important topics to?crack IBPS Clerk Prelims 2017?with a good score:Reading Comprehension\r\nExpect about 10 questions?of the RC type.?In IBPS clerk the RC would mostly be story based.

'AROUND 11.45 every night, ?Kumar Anna? pulls in on a bicycle next to Inorbit Mall in Goregaon, three large steel cans and a stack of paper cups hanging from the handlebars. In the shadows of the mall, under a streetlight, he props up his bicycle, sets up his idli-wada shop and waits for business to begin. He has been doing this almost every night for 14 years now and that has earned him a string of loyal customers.By 12.15 am, a crowd gathers around him. ?I didn?t always sell idlis and wadas. For almost a decade, I hawked coffee at night. But always at night,? said Kumar, who refuses to be identified by his actual name. ?The idea to sell at night came out of desperation,? he added.When he moved from Tirunelveli to Mumbai in 1994 looking for a job, he couldn?t find one. Kumar started to borrow utensils from a tea vendor at night and making coffee. He would sell the coffee at night and return the utensils in the morning. ?Near the footpaths in Marve where I stayed, I met a tea vendor who shut his shop by 10pm. That?s when the idea struck and eventually, I realised there was a demand for food and tea at night,? he said.?I am aware it is illegal to hawk at night. But people work round-the-clock in the city and need to eat. As long as I am careful about my business, I can manage,? Kumar said.Today, Kumar has a dedicated workspace where a team of two prepares idlis, wadas, sambhar and chutneys.\r\nOn a good day, he sells food to almost 200 customers between 12 midnight and 3 am. ?There are a bunch of call centres in the area that work late in the night. So, there are customers every day. But business is better on weekends,? said Kumar.Apart from call centre employees, he has a few regular customers from the garbage collection unit of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). An employee of the BMC?s solid waste management department said: ?For those of us on the night shift, there is hardly any option as most food outlets are shut. When we are hungry, we drop by Kumar Anna?s idli shop. He has always maintained his quality and it is affordable.?A plate of idlis or wadas costs Rs 35 and tea and coffee are priced at Rs 15.',real
'On October 7, a boulder the size of house broke off a mountain in the Araku Valley region in Andhra Pradesh and fell on a 50-year-old railway bridge, destroying one of its piers for good and rendering the country?s highest broad-gauge freight line useless.Within five days, Indian Railways started the work of restoring the bridge, including building a 28-metre pier rooted in the rocky range from scratch, diverting a waterfall that has a sharp eight-degree curve, and restoring the steep tracks. The deadline: 60 days.While the government has brought in the Army to build three foot over bridges in Mumbai suburban stations for ?faster execution of work?, this project being executed by the East Coast Railway Zone is not just an engineering challenge but also requires time-bound execution on a ?war footing?. The work is being monitored 24X7 with drones and other wireless camera feeds, right up to the level of the Railway Board.?We are on schedule. Traffic will be restored by December 12, as targeted,? Umesh Singh, General Manager of East Coast Railway, told The Sunday Express.The 445-km Kothavalasa-Kirandul line, known simply as the KK line, running through the dense mountains of the Eastern Ghats, is the steepest broad-gauge freight line in the Indian Railways, connecting the NMDC?s iron ore mines in Chhattisgarh with Vishakhapatnam?s steel plants and port. The line and bridge were commissioned in the late 1960s, with financial and technical assistance from Japan, to aid India?s push towards industrialisation. It has 58 tunnels and 84 major bridges, including the 85-metre ?Bridge 249? that is now being rebuilt.In the absence of the line, freight is currently being moved on the Koraput-Rayagada-Vizianagram line, which is a 150-km diversion. The boulder weighing nearly 700 tonnes that fell on the bridge not only shattered its pier but also dislodged the iron girders. In the dense mountains, the access to the site of the bridge to carry out the work is blocked by a waterfall.?From the day the damage was discovered, we have been on war mode, so to speak. An emergency single tender was given out within a couple of days. We are losing around Rs 2 crore per day in the absence of the line, so the timeline for the job is non-negotiable,? said Mukul S Mathur, Divisonal Railway Manager (DRM) of Waltair Divison of East Coast Railway, which is carrying out the work. The entire Indian Railways network is divided into 68 divisions, each headed by a DRM.It involved first breaking the damaged pier that held the bridge upright, removing the girder, and making a fresh pier, while negotiating the topography that is treacherous not just for the workers but also the heavy machinery. Apart from the waterfall that has to be diverted, the bridge is flanked by tunnels on both sides.The Waltair Division estimates the restoration will cost Rs 7 crore. The engineers laid out a 500-metre approach to get the men and machinery to the base of the pier, while the waterfall was diverted using pipes and channels to reach the bridge. The damaged pier was broken using short-fuse controlled explosives and special chemicals, and the girder was carried away while holding up the remaining bridge with a temporary crib structure.',real
'Twelve years after you wrote The World is Flat, globalisation and its certainties seem to have been overturned.\r\nThe book was about how we had created a global economic playing field, where more people can connect and collaborate. The technologies that were flattening and integrating the world are alive and well. They are even more powerful than when I wrote the book. Some people are trying to resist the implications of that and shaking their fists at change.But something like Brexit is a big blow.\r\nThose are real big blows. But the world is more interconnected than ever. And in such a world, you get a geopolitical inversion: your rival?s fall is more dangerous than its rise. If China takes six more islands in the South China Sea, I couldn?t care less. But if China loses six per cent growth, this hotel [in Bengaluru] will be affected. Those forces are very much at play. It does not mean that no one will resist them, but the price you pay in resisting them will be bigger than ever.Your most recent book, Thank You For Being Late (2016, Allen Lane), tries to understand the future of work in an age of ?accelerations?.\r\nOnce a vast majority of us worked with their hands, then came a time when we worked with our hands, and in the age to come, we will work with our hearts. Because that?s the only thing a machine will never have.In the book, I interview Vivek Murthy, the Indian-American surgeon general who Donald Trump fired. I asked him what the most lethal disease in America was. Cancer, heart disease or diabetes? He said, ?None of those. It is isolation.? If that?s the case, connecting hearts to hearts will be a big industry.What does that mean?\r\nFor example, take Paint Nite, the fastest growing restaurant chain in America in 2015. It allows adults to come together in bars, they paint by numbers and have a drink together. The thing is that people want to be connected. The more we are online, the more we want to rub up against another human. And I think that?s the next growth industry.You write that the worker of the future has to be someone who is constantly updating herself. Isn?t this just the kind of psychological pressure that people are unable to keep up with and that led to the anger against globalisation?\r\nYes, no question. One of my teachers, Heather McGowan, says that the days when you would get a four-year degree and then expect to dine on it for the next 30 years are over. Because what you learn in your first year is going to be outdated by your fourth year. So, the single-most important competitive advantage is to be a lifelong learner. She also says that you should never ask a kid today what you want to be when you grow up. Because whatever it is, unless it is a cop or a fireman, the job isn?t going to be there. Only ask: how are you going to be who you are? Are you predisposed to be a lifelong learner? A lot of people are built to do what they are told. But doing what you are told is not going to be enough. That has a lot of people freaked out. And I think it is frightening to people to be in a constant learning mode. And that?s going to be a challenge.But can this be something left to the individual alone? What role do governments and corporations have to play in this?\r\nVery good question. The reason my book ends in my hometown of Minnesota is not because of nostalgia. I believe that as the world accelerates, national governments are not going to be fast enough to cope with this pace. At the other extreme, the single family is way too weak to resist these accelerations. So, I am arguing that the proper government for the 21stcentury is the healthy community. There is a lot more civic trust at that level. If I were running for president, which I am not, I would run as a progressive localist?In the book, I talk about AT&T. The tech company has created in-house nano degrees and is giving its employees money to take the courses and train themselves. Its social contract with its employees is that you can be a lifelong employee but only if you are a lifelong learner. And that is the social contract coming to a neighbourhood near you.How does education cope?\r\nI have written about Opportunity@Work, an NGO which uses an intelligent algorithm to match what you can do to a job available. Many employers are no longer interested in your pedigree, but if you can do a job. And if someone can badge you ? saying yes, you have this skill ? an employer will say, I am going to hire you. It is a great avenue for those who started but could not finish college. These are all ways to accelerate learning.How far can globalisation go without fixing its inequality problem?\r\nYes, the top one per cent is getting fantastically rich. But the bottom is also rising, and I see that whenever I am in India. The gap is not getting bridged. That?s what tax policy is for, what governments are for. But I don?t think you tear the whole system down.How divisive has the Trump presidency been?\r\nI knew it was going to be bad, I didn?t know it was going to be this bad. It is a full-blown disaster. I believe Donald Trump is a disturbed person and he is also an indecent man. We have never had someone who is such a casual liar as our president. I see a steady breakdown of norms, which keep a society in check and moving forward.How do you see the press holding up?\r\nWe [The New York Times] are standing up. Our digital subscriptions are through the roof, and that?s partly thanks to Trump. Because people don?t want fake news, they want real news. The Washington Post is thriving. The war between the NYT and WaPO is a beautiful thing to watch. Two outstanding newspapers, based on real news value, every day going head to head, breaking stories.In the future, will we need oped writers?\r\nCan you programme a robot to have an opinion? I am sure you can but the idea to write The World is Flat came when I was talking to a bunch of human beings. I don?t think a computer can do it. It doesn?t have that kind of intuition.',real
'According to the latest data released by Dubai?s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (Dubai Tourism), India has retained top spot on Dubai?s list of source markets for inbound tourism, with 1,478,000 Indian tourists arriving in the city between January and September, registering a significant 20 per cent rise over the same period in 2016.This increase affirmed the effectiveness of various innovative promotional activities driven by Dubai Tourism in the market, including highly successful influencer-led collaborations with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, a statement said.Saudi Arabia and the UK also retained their positions as Dubai?s second and third largest feeder markets.?The sustained growth ahead of the global average that we have witnessed so far this year is indicative of the positive impact yielded by our consolidated strategy across regulatory measures, promotional efforts, trade initiatives and partner programmes. Even as we continually work to ensure Dubai?s proposition remains stellar and globally competitive, drawing on the concerted cross-industry efforts of all stakeholders, our priority remains the delivery of the highest levels of visitor satisfaction.?Ultimately, our aim is to make every satisfied Dubai visitor our customer for life and our strongest advocate, in order to drive not only higher repeat traffic but also acquire newer audiences most efficiently, as we strive towards our 20 million target by 2020,? Helal Saeed Almarri, Director General, Dubai Tourism, said in a statement.Dubai?s hotel sector also saw significant growth, with the city?s total number of hotel and hotel apartment keys standing at 106,167 at the end of the third quarter of 2017. A total of 11.58 million international overnight visitors arrived in Dubai during the first nine months of 2017, reflecting a 7.5 per cent increase over the same period last year.And, in line with the 10X Agenda set by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ?we are focused on continuously innovating, harnessing the power of data, redefining the customer journey and amplifying the voice of the traveller, to ensure that Dubai is a decade ahead of any other global city from a travel and tourism perspective,?

'An Indian-origin pharmacist on trial for the murder of his elderly father by injecting him with a lethal dose of morphine has been freed by a UK judge, who ruled that he had acted out of ?mercy and pure compassion?.Bipin Desai had denied the murder charge but admitted to assisting his 85-year-old father Dhirajlal?Desai commit suicide at their home in Surrey, south-east England, because he had been depressed and wanted to end his life.?Your acts of assistance were acts of pure compassion and mercy. Your father had a solid and firm wish to die. Being assisted to die would be fulfilling his wish of going to heaven to see his wife and being put out of his misery,? Justice Green told Desai during a sentencing hearing at Guildford Crown Court yesterday.The court heard how Desai?s father had begged daily for help in ending his life after his wife and dog died.?Finally, the 59-year-old pharmacist put morphine stolen from his pharmacy into his father?s smoothie in August, 2015.Then he gave his father the drink and kissed him goodnight and goodbye and later injected insulin to speed up the fatal dose.?We have a man who wanted to die, not because he was terribly ill but, sadly, because he had just had enough of life,? Desai?s defence lawyer told the court.Justice Green directed the jury to bring in a not-guilty verdict and handed Desai a nine-month suspended sentence for his assisted suicide plea, which means he would not have to spend any time behind bars as long as he does not breach the court?s conditions.A?letter to the judge written by Desai?s wife Dipti was read out in court by their lawyer, which explained that her husband had also tried to kill himself on several occasions.?Since August 2015 our lives have been turned completely upside down and have never been the same for any of us,? she wrote.One of their two sons, Samir, told the court, ?My dad is the best person I know. He was left with an impossible choice and chose the road which gave my grandfather peace?.Desai had?pleaded guilty to two counts of theft relating to stealing the two drugs, morphine and insulin, from his workplace of Vaughan James Chemist in Farnham but the judge ruled those as trivial.?The thefts are trivial and only form part of the fabric of the wider case. The owner of the pharmacy said in his evidence that you were an honest, respectful and decent man,? the judge noted.After the verdict, Bipin Desai said he now wants to properly grieve for his father.??The past two years have been a time of immense stress for our family and it is a huge relief this ordeal is over,? he said.',real
'Some years ago, I spent several months studying the official correspondence of P.N. Haksar, who was principal secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from 1967 to 1973. In his letters and reports, Haksar came across as a man of patriotism and erudition. He deeply loved his country and fervently wished for its progress and prosperity. He was widely read in history and the humanities, and had a serious interest in science and technology as well. At the same time, Haksar was not afflicted at all by self-doubt. Reading his papers, I was impressed, indeed astonished, at how he was so sure of himself while prescribing policies and making appointments in spheres well beyond his domain of expertise.Haksar?s boss ? whose birth centenary falls this Sunday ? shared both his patriotism and his certitude. Indira Gandhi lived and died for India, and she thought she knew better than any other Indian what was good and best for India. Hence her lack of interest in Parliament, and her barely concealed contempt for the Opposition (this was manifest well before she jailed her opponents during the Emergency). Hence, also, her destruction of the culture of inner-party democracy within the Congress, so that her party, and her cabinet, became entirely subordinated to her will, and whim.The health of a democracy depends on a properly functioning Parliament and a vigorous and effective Opposition. And it depends, as critically, on autonomous and independent public institutions. In the 1950s, ruling party politicians did not determine the allocation of top jobs within the bureaucracy, as well as within regulatory institutions. This changed with the advent of Indira Gandhi, who, actively aided by P.N. Haksar, came up with the idea of the ?committed civil servant?, and going further, of the ?committed judiciary?. Once, senior public servants in the Government of India were chosen and promoted on the basis of proven competence or track record. Now, whether the prime minister liked or approved of an official also became an important factor in appointments to senior positions.Like Indira Gandhi, Haksar was a Kashmiri Pandit by birth. So were some other key advisors of the prime minister. However, ethnic origin was not really central to career prospects; what mattered more was depth of commitment to the Leader and her ideology. Whether he was Tamil or Bengali, Hindu or Muslim, a ?committed? official had to believe in Mrs Gandhi?s brand of state socialism, and tacitly endorse her bypassing of parliamentary procedure. And he had to be utterly loyal to her, even when asked to do things contrary to constitutional practice or the norms and traditions of his office.I do not mean to suggest that we had a fantastically capable civil service before Indira Gandhi became prime minister. In Nehru?s and Shastri?s day, there were officials who were able, focussed and hardworking, as well as officials who were lazy, incompetent and corrupt. But whether good, bad, or indifferent, top officials and judges were appointed and functioned independently of the prime minister. The autonomy of the institution was kept intact, as it must be in a constitutional democracy. It was this that changed with the advent of Indira Gandhi. Now, politics and personality intruded into, and impeded the functioning of, the executive and the judiciary.Once corroded, the autonomy of public institutions could not be restored. After Indira Gandhi?s death, however, the corrosion took different forms. For one thing, it became more decentralised. Later prime ministers were not as powerful as Mrs Gandhi, so individual ministers took to interfering with, and determining, senior appointments. For another, caste and ethnicity began to play a greater role. Personal loyalty to the minister mattered, of course, but it also helped if you shared his caste, religion, language or state.Were this a longer essay, I would provide a more wide-ranging assessment of Indira Gandhi?s career. I would write of her positive contributions, as in the winning of the Bangladesh war, the carrying forward of Shastri?s and C. Subramaniam?s programmes of food security, the establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation, the promotion of our great craft traditions, and the sponsorship of the successful Festivals of India, soft power at its best. I would also then write of her other negative contributions, as in the further consolidation of the licence-permit-quota raj, and the conversion of the great party of the freedom struggle into a family firm.A short column must have a sharper focus, and the one I have chosen is, I think, extremely pertinent to the present. Unlike Indira Gandhi, Narendra Modi was not born into privilege. He comes from a very different ideological tradition. Yet his political style is markedly similar. Like Indira Gandhi, he dislikes and suspects an independent media; and rarely gives interviews or entertains difficult questions in public. Like her, he does not place a high value on parliamentary debate, and he can be contemptuous of the Opposition (consider his recent characterisation of the Congress as ?termites? to be exterminated). Like her, he absolutely dominates his cabinet and party. Like her, when it comes to appointing senior officials, he values personal as well as ideological loyalty ? hence the fact, surely not a coincidence, that so many top jobs in the Government of India have recently gone to Gujarat cadre officers.',real

Some three decades ago, lawyers had an unwritten code fixing a maximum fee limit per hearing in the Supreme Court and the High Court. This rule was broken by some senior lawyers who insisted that they would charge whatever they deemed fit. Now sky is the limit as far as legal fees are concerned. Often, even when the senior counsel does not show up in court, the poor client still has to cough up. Payments are often made in cash.Elephantine exerciseThe Income Tax raids on Sasikala and her nephew T T V Dinakaran were aptly named Operation Elephant. The exercise went on for over a week and is considered among the biggest such operations in the tax department?s history. There were 1,245 senior and junior officials inducted for the operation, including 30 women. Some 142 offices and residences were raided and around 250 bank accounts frozen. According to the political grapevine in the state, Rs 30,000 crore of unaccounted party funds have been recovered. The numbers may be highly exaggerated, but no one doubts that the money uncovered is indeed substantial. Not surprisingly, the raids have sent shock waves through various factions of the AIADMK.Among scorpionsBeing a woman in politics is tough as Jaya Jaitly?s recently released and eminently readable book, Life Among The Scorpions, reveals. From slander to setting her up in the Tehelka case, her male counterparts were out to get her, she writes. Jaya writes that even when she was the president of the Samata Party, her male colleagues would shout loudly to drown out her voice. They would expect her to serve tea or offer comments on her looks. She writes that George Fernandes, her mentor, wanted to compensate her for all the sacrifices she had made for the party by trying to get her a Rajya Sabha seat. But she mysteriously lost out each time. Initially, her name was proposed from the Rajya Sabha nominated category but was dropped at the last minute. Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee claimed that President Abdul Kalam had scuttled the nomination. Kalam in turn said the PM had requested him not to sign on the file as a senior woman ministerial colleague had reservations. Then, Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala gave the nomination to the very person who had egged Jaya on to try for the same seat. Later, after giving an assurance, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar backed out and instead nominated King Mahendra, a strongman with a checkered career in both business and politics.Age no barrier',real

'IN A major breakthrough for security forces in Kashmir, six ?foreign? militants, including the nephew of Lashkar-e-Toiba chief and alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, were killed in a gunbattle on Saturday in north Kashmir?s Hajin area.Officials said the operation also resulted in the death of an IAF Garud commando and injuries to a soldier from 13 Rashtriya Rifles. J&K DGP S P Vaid said, ?Six LeT terrorists including two commanders, Mehmood and Zargam, were eliminated, and weapons and ammunition recovered from them.??Vaid confirmed that one of the militants killed was Owaid alias Osama, 25, the son of Lakhvi?s brother Zaki-ur-Rehman Makki. Police sources said Owaid had entered the Valley last year through Kupwara or Gurez, along with a group of militants. He was active in north Kashmir before zeroing in on the Hajin area this year, they said.Another of the militants killed was identified as Mehmood Bhai, the in-charge of LeT operations in north Kashmir and operating in the Hajin area over the last year. Police and the Army had launched several operations in Hajin and Bandipore to trap Mehmood and other LeT militants active there. Sources said that a third militant who was killed, Zargam, was active in the Ganderbal area. Mehmood and Zargam are believed to have been active in the Valley since 2015.Police are trying to establish the identities of the three other militants killed. The Garud commando, who died in the gunbattle, has been identified as Corporal Jyoti Prakash Nirala, 31, from Badiladih village in Bihar?s Rohtas district. He is survived by his wife and a three-year-old daughter.Over the last 10 days, J&K Police and Rashtriya Rifles had launched several ?cordon and search? operations in Hajin and adjacent villages after receiving inputs about the movement of foreign militants in the area. On Saturday afternoon, officials said, the Special Operation Group of J&K Police and 13 RR established a cordon around Chandergeer village, 5 km from Hajin town. As the forces started moving in, the militants came out firing from a house.The Garud commando died in the gunbattle that ensued before all the six militants were killed. Police sources said the militants may have gathered in the house for a meeting. Defence spokesperon Col Rajesh Kalia told The Indian Express that the operation was launched jointly by 13 RR and J&K Police after specific information about militant presence in the area was received.The Indian Express had reported on September 21 that Owaid alias Osama was the third member of Lakhvi?s family to join the LeT?s ranks and be part of its operations in Kashmir. His elder brother Musaib was killed in an encounter in the Hajin area of Bandipore district in January this year. In 2007, Lakhvi?s 20-year-old son Mohammad Qasim was killed in a gunbattle with the Army and J&K police.In the first week of November, a nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar was killed in Aglar village along with another local militant, with forces recovering a US-made M4 rifle from the encounter site. This is the first time that two close relatives of Pakistan-based commanders of LeT and JeM were killed by security forces in a month.',real
'The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Saturday admitted a petition seeking further investigation into the killing of 19 civilians in Sailan village of Poonch 19 years ago. The families of the victims have sought further probe after the CBI closed the case saying that the families were ?untruthful?. Acting on the petition filed by the victims? families, challenging the CBI?s closure report, the court issued notice to the CBI asking it to respond. The case has been reopened for the second time by the court.On the intervening night of August 3 and 4 in 1998, 19 civilians ? 13 females and 6 males ? were killed inside their homes at point blank range in Sailan. Eleven of them were children. The families alleged that four Special Police Officers (SPOs) of J&K Police and personnel of 9 Para battalion of the Army were responsible for the killings. They alleged that the killers were led by Major Guarav Rishi of Army?s 9 Para. The families had been accusing J&K Police of covering up the massacre.In 2011, the families approached the high court seeking reopening of the case. In 2012, the HC directed the CBI to reinvestigate. On August 27, 2015, the CBI filed a closure report saying the families were not ?truthful?. Two years later, the CBI court accepted the investigations.The families again approached the HC challenging the order of the CBI court.

'Activist and former BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kanu Kalsariya filed his nomination from Mahuva Assembly constituency in Bhavnagar district as an Independent even as the ruling BJP announced to field its sitting MLA Bhavna Makwana?s husband Raghavaji as its candidate from the seat on Friday. This marks return of Kalsariya to his old backyard of Mahuva after trying to seek support of voters in neighbouring Gariyadhar Assembly constituency in 2012.Accompanied by scores of his supporters, Kalsariya filed his nomination papers with the office of returning officer of Mahuva as an Independent candidate on Friday. This is for the fifth time that Kalsariya, who is a general surgeon, has jumped in the fray for an Assembly constituency. He had won from Mahuva seat as a BJP candidate in 1998, 2002 and 2007.

May be, I was overconfident. In the Lok Sabha election, those close to me asked me not to contest. But AAP leadership told me that if I would not contest, nobody else will contest in Gujarat.

'Sport boasts of glorious tales of overcoming adversity: economic and social hardships, physical impediments, parental opposition, geography and gender. Kidambi Srikanth has not necessarily encountered those. All he dreads is travel ? a prerequisite for international sport.Talk of that encumbrance brings a grimace to his face, and leads him to pinch his nose and scrunch his eyes. It might never stop him from ruling badminton some day in the future but, suffice to say, he isn?t the sea-faring Popeye smacking at feathered birds. So, Srikanth will brood a bit and sulk some more before he sets off on yet another round of tournaments.Everyone close to him ? his parents, brother Nandagopal, coach P Gopichand and physio Kiran Challagunda ? knows that once he fetches up on court in any part of the world, he is capable of staking claim to the title. Opponents and rival coaches remain wary of the 24-year-old hitting a purple patch, shredding reputations of Olympic and World Championship-proportions (he is yet to win those), and playing five sublime matches in a week to pick Super Series championships (he does have six of those).The women, Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, have taken off over the last decade; the men now need to catch up and the bets are on Srikanth to deliver the big medals. But how to get this notoriously reticent man cracking (and packing) remains a challenge.We catch him on a particularly bad day in Hyderabad soon after the World Championships. ?I?m travelling so much, I have started hating it. I love being at one place,? he mutters. This cribbing comes after he?s made it to the finals of the Singapore, Indonesia and Australian Opens, winning two of those. So, you know he will complain, then pack his bags and push off to eventually win more titles. He promptly claims the Denmark Open a few weeks later ? and the French Open last Sunday. In a span of three months, he has travelled and triumphed across three continents. ?I didn?t get time to celebrate because I had to take an immediate flight to Paris. I?ll celebrate after I go back to Hyderabad,? he says. Older brother Nandagopal chuckles as he predicts what shape that party will take ? the tight-knit family of four, parents and two sons, eating out at a quiet restaurant.Srikanth might have a 100 visa stamps on his passports, but he insists his idea of a perfect holiday is running back home. ?I stay away from home so much. Every time I get time, I want to go home,? he had said before coach Gopichand asked his parents to relocate to Hyderabad from Guntur, a little startled by Srikanth?s bouts of homesickness. The family took up a villa in Gachibowli, reuniting almost after a decade of the boys camping out at badminton academies across the state ? Khammam, Guntur, Vijayawada and Hyderabad.Srikanth craved Indian food wherever he travelled, and home food when he was at Hyderabad training at the Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy. ?I love to sit back home, relax with a few friends and joke about small things. I enjoy doing nothing,? he says.For all that searing ambition he is expected to feel, Srikanth?s career had started as ?timepass?. He recalls the usual fights with brother Nandu for the TV remote and the front seat, but the two were thick and Srikanth followed the older sibling into badminton. His father was a reasonably well-off land-owning farmer in Guntur (then a part of Andhra Pradesh), and though the parents insisted that studies and sport ought to get equal attention, Srikanth was gravitating towards badminton. ?I watched the 2001 All England final, the first-ever sport I watched. To be frank, I didn?t know anything about badminton?s history. I only got to know it when I turned pro,? he says.Gopichand would visit Guntur where Srikanth was training under coach Sudhakar Reddy. He was doing well but his laidback attitude meant there was no spark that could prompt Gopichand to take him on board. Nandagopal had shown early signs of what is now a left-handed full-throttle backhand jump smash and left for Hyderabad, while the parents had to step in to ensure Srikanth could follow at the age of 15.?Nandu was senior in everything, even in getting serious about the sport. I started going to the stadium and slowly began enjoying it. Doubles was so different from singles, I used to like it, and win so much,? he recalls. He struck up a long partnership and friendship with another player, Hema Nagendra Babu.?Gopi Sir is a big mentor. He?s not friendly or anything, but there?s just great communication with him. In my junior years, he would shout and get angry because of how I was,? he says. Reluctant is what he was. Or living in a world of his own.Babu remembers a sleepless Srikanth waking up in the middle of the night to narrate his plans. Of becoming a film director. ?He would talk about the scenes he would direct in the movies he?d make ? not who the hero or heroine would be, but what the shot would look like and where the camera would be,? he says. Deeply impressed by Telugu director Sekhar Kammula, who made the hit Happy Days in 2007, Srikanth would describe entire scenes and storylines. ?He used to love imagining screenplays based on what happened at the academy,? he says. Till recently, they would laugh away, casting characters from the academy in Bahubali roles and make merry.Actually, there were three ? Srikanth, Babu and Gopi Raju ? living in a mini bachelor?s pad. ?Room 107 was memorable. It used to be untidy, with clothes thrown all around and cleaned only when Gopi bhaiyya or his mother came for inspections. There was a camera placed right outside,? Babu recalls. It was this camera that once caught their mischief. The tell-tale sign was two empty boxes, with the Domino?s pizzas inside polished off. ?We used to successfully order biryani late at night without anyone knowing because Gopi bhaiyya would sleep at 9. The camera caught the empty pizza boxes, and he was furious,? he says.Srikanth and his buddies would be ordered to fetch up on court at 4.30 the next morning as punishment and give multi-shuttle feeding practice to juniors, followed by their own training without a break for six hours. ?But he liked our discipline because we never went out or drank and were generally responsible,? Babu says.Room 107 saw other capers too. Srikanth would round up juniors from the academy for a game of cricket in the room. ?He would make them bat and bowl because he used to love fielding. He was very good at it,? he says. Srikanth?s big passion back then was carrom. They would play all-nighters, and even had a hot bulb fixed over the table, which would light up just the board.By now, Srikanth, playing at the net, was trading in pushes and half-smashes, adding strength and speed to his defence and strokes. A smash from the back court began to take shape as he started focussing on singles. ?I didn?t stick to one partner after Srikanth,? says Babu, who would go on to join the Railways in 2014.It took Gopichand some time and goading ? in the middle of shepherding careers of Nehwal, Sindhu and P Kashyap ? to steer Srikanth towards singles. The Hyderabadi was first noticed when he beat Thailand?s Boonsak Ponsana at the latter?s home event exactly four Octobers ago. He had collapsed in the washroom from brain fever later, and his recovery and title-winning run later in China had been as much a silent relief as a brass band announcing its arrival.He has made a habit of beating the world?s top names in their backyard, and slowly breaking the hearts of home fans ? he snapped shut twice Olympic champ and five-time world champion Lin Dan in China in 2014 and recently schooled the reigning world champ Viktor Axelsen in Denmark.The youngster seemed to remain aloof from fame though. He hadn?t warmed up to it even after claiming his second Super Series title. ?I needed to win the last point of the 2015 India Open final in Delhi to really assure myself that I was winning,? he says. When he won the Denmark Open last week, he was self-conscious on his way to court, before shyly giving a high-five to the Donald Duck mascot.If he has been mobbed ever, he hasn?t quite noticed. ?No, no, I don?t ever get mobbed,? he says, incredulous. ?When people came up to me at a Hyderabad mall, I realised, ?Oh, people really watch badminton!??It could be that superstardom comes easily to Nehwal and Sindhu, both affable girls never short on confidence. But be it Kashyap or Sai Praneeth or Srikanth, the men tend to pull on goofball faces and boast an easy, matter-of-fact wit, wearing their celebrity more lightly when going about playing Indian sport?s biggest catch-up.Globally, though, ?Ki-daam-bi? is a mini-phenomenon, acknowledged as one of the finest talents in men?s singles today. The knowledgeable badminton world of East Asia and West Europe reckons Srikanth is the young prince in waiting, jostling to take over from the legends of the game, Lin Dan and Chong Wei, who are fading out slowly but surely. Chen Long is the next in line but Kidambi converts neutrals to diehard fans faster than his smash-and-charge-the-net routine that is the talk of the town when he slays his rivals.There is the big smash for everyone to swoon over, the pouncing net taps for those who sit back for a second dekko and, finally, the deception at the net for the aficionados. Nehwal had the power and grit, Sindhu thrives on speed and endurance, but Srikanth came into badminton with sublime strokes ? unconventional because some are borrowed from the doubles game, and unreadable for opponents. India has had winners in the last decade, but in Srikanth lies the promise of greatness, if he can rise to the big moments.For better or for worse, he goes about this challenge unrushed, reserving all the flurry and pace only for his formidable attacks. Watching a Srikanth match is savouring every rally and not quite knowing when his layered game, with its deft deceptions and shot selection, will turn the tables on his opponent. Not so much an outwitting of opponents as out-conjuring by a wizard. And because it?s so innate, Srikanth struggles at deconstructing it for muggles. ?I?m not really thinking about winning, I only want to be consistent and play my best.?He values precision. ?At that particular moment, if I can send the shuttle in a particular direction, I think I?ve played well that day,? he says. Consistency is a desired quality for a shuttler like him. ?You don?t really get to smash always,? he wryly smiles as he mulls the transitions from defence to attack. ?I put in a lot of effort into understanding my defensive training, because that is the only way I?d know when I can attack,? he says.On days when he is in ominous form, no opponent looks unbeatable. ?For me, playing in the zone means when you feel really confident. .. You feel free on court, as if everything is working for you?I?m playing sharp and every shuttle gets into the court.?He talks about feeling free because he?s felt severely constricted at times, when badminton?s gotten overbearing. Brother Nandagopal talks of the Himalayan pressure that Srikanth brought upon himself soon after beating Lin Dan. ?Social media had become big then, and he used to be very touchy about everything the press said,? he recalls. Around the badminton league in 2015, he had even snapped when quizzed by the media about his head-to-head with Chong Wei. ?When he stopped over-thinking and realised he can control only his badminton and nothing else, he matured. If he wins, he starts preparing for the next tournament. If he loses, he gives credit to the opponent and moves on,? Nandagopal says.The two have shared a room for 16 years now. ?I know he was upset after losing in the quarters of the Olympics (to Lin Dan). But he got over it and has won three titles this year. It took time, but he matured,? he says. The loss at Rio had been rough, his pain visceral, but he disappeared from view for a few days and returned wiser. ?I?m not worried about losing, I don?t want to be super happy when I win either. I just don?t want to have any regrets after a match. I want to play every stroke that can get me a win,? Srikanth says, shrugging off his loss against Korean Son Wan Ho at the World Championships too.You?d think his fabulous run this season has him setting Tokyo 2020 in his sights. But he shuts off the topic. ?First of all, it?s the Olympics, not easy. In a sport like badminton, I need to first qualify for Tokyo. Get rankings, play tournaments, and then everything will fall into place,? he says.Cocooned inside the world of training-tournaments-family-coach, Srikanth?s other interest is checking out the latest creation of Odisha?s sand artist Sudarshan Pattnaik. He grew up a fair bit on India?s quiet eastern coast, and he loved that his Maldives title came at a seafront. He reckons badminton is a bit like sand art ? carving mounds of golden dust into something beautiful in that moment, and then letting the waves wash over it to build a new one the next day. Srikanth is building sand castles alright, but on terra firma. ?I want to have that mark of being one of the best players in the world. To be known as someone who won every tournament. I want people to say here is someone who won everything and so many world championships,? he states his ultimate goal.What about material possessions? ?I don?t shop too much ? only when it?s necessary.? Or cars: ?I drive, but I?m not obsessed with cars ? you just need one car to reach wherever you need to go; not a fleet.? What about money? ?I?ll wish I always have enough ? but it?s not very important.? On being non-cricket?s Virat Kohli, because of his aggression and all that: ?Hahahahahaha, I don?t know. I haven?t thought of that.?He is known to keep to himself at most times, and open up only in the company of friends or family. He watches tennis, digs Roger Federer, and started playing tennis with his brother, as an ode. Dhoni is his gold standard for consistency and temperament, and ?getting the job done with minimal fuss.? His equanimity is right from the Dhoni manual of thinking.The closest he?s found magic in life is watching physio Challagunda fix his injuries. ?You need to have complete belief in someone, and fully rely on them. He?s been watching over me from day one, he explains to me what my body has gone through.?He sports a variety of amulets, but reckons it?s best to prop up his game, and leave nothing to divinity. ?I believe in God, but I?m not someone who?ll leave everything to God. 90 per cent is my hard work.?',real

'A rarity is on the cards on the fourth day of the first Test between India and Sri Lanka. After a demolition show in Sri Lanka in the three Tests, India are going to concede first innings lead and the islanders would deserve every bit of it. The credit, largely, goes to Lahiru Thirimanne and Angelo Mathews who struck defiant fifties on the third day to put together 99 runs and take Sri Lanka towards a deficit of just 7 runs. At early stumps, due to fading light, Sri Lanka stood at 165/4 ? without the duo ? and still looking reasonably comfortable.

'A day after US-based credit rating agency Moody?s Investors Services upgraded India?s sovereign rating to Baa2 ? from Baa3 ? with a stable outlook, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday said the government should not be lured into a ?false belief? that the economy is out of the woods.At a separate event, P Chidambaram, senior Congress leader and a former Finance minister under Singh, criticised the government?s acceptance of Moody?s ratings upgrade by pointing out that it had questioned the Moody?s methodology not long ago.On demonetisation, Chidambaram said, ?I have reason to believe he (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) was not told that 86 per cent of currency was withdrawn. He was not told demonetisation must be followed by remonetisation, (and) in this case there wasn?t enough currency; (that) the RBI has not printed the replacement currency. The RBI board meeting was a farce. It was called on November 7 (2016). We don?t have a copy of the notice of the meeting?we asked for it. There was no background note. It was denied under RTI on grounds of national security. It lasted for all of half-an-hour.?Speaking with the media on the sidelines of a seminar on ?Macroeconomic development in India; policy perspectives,?? at St Teresa?s College in Ernakulam, former PM Singh said, ?I am glad that Moody?s have done what they have done but we must not be, I think, lured into false belief that we are out of the woods,? Singh said. Pointing out that crude oil prices are now at $62-64 per barrel, up from about $40-45 a few months ago, the former PM said, ?It (rising crude prices) can hurt balance of payment. It can also hurt the fiscal system.?On GST, Singh said, ?GST is an idea which had the blessing of the Congress, but we would have implemented it after due care and adequate preparation.?Stating that there is ?much to be desired? in both administration and implementation of GST, he said, ?The fact that the (GST) Council has met so many times ? they have now reduced (tax) rates of 211 items ? showed that there was undue haste in implementation, and the bureaucracy had not done its homework. The net impact of hasty implementation of GST is that it led to the slowdown of our economic growth.?Speaking at the Tata Literature Live! The Mumbai Litfest 2017, Chidambaram said, ?Just some months ago, (the) government had said the Moody?s methodology was all wrong..

'The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS) has filed complaints against a programme held at the PWD Ground in New Sangvi, between November 10 and 12. According to the MANS, speakers at the programme, ?Deliverance Festival in Pune?, allegedly cheated people by ?making unscientific and false claims about curing serious illnesses, such as heart diseases and cancer, by offering prayers?.A poster on the programme, among several put up across the city, purportedly stated ?come and be delivered from sin, sickness, curses, and bindings of evil spirits?, and mentioned contact numbers of the ?United Christian Fellowship, Pune?.On Friday, MANS officials held meetings with Pune Police Commissioner Rashmi Shukla and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Cell, Sudhir Hiremath. They demanded that an offence be registered in connection with this programme under sections of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, and also under sections of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954.The matter was brought to the notice of the MANS by Jaywant Jadhav, Anand Raichur and Rahul Bangonde, who claim to be members of pro-Hindutva groups. Nandini Jadhav, district president of MANS, said, ?Jaywant Jadhav, a local resident, had filed a complaint with MANS about the programme on the PWD ground. We verified the facts and found that false claims, which spread superstition, were made by the speakers. So, we filed a complaint with the Sangvi police station on November 12. But no offence was lodged? so we filed complaints with the police commissioner and DCP, Cyber Cell? no action has been taken by the Sangvi police station? a proper inquiry should be conducted and an offence should be registered??.?Videos of the programmes on PWD ground were posted on YouTube in three parts. We submitted all three YouTube links with our police complaint. But soon, the videos were removed from the site. This is suspicious.

'Three months after deciding to axe the manual typewriting exam in the state, the Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to give the go-ahead for resuming manual typing courses.\r\n?The government is giving approval for starting typing courses in all government-approved shorthand and typewriting institutes till November 30, 2019.All approved institutes should change their syllabus to include computer typing along with manual typewriting lessons. After November 30, 2019, the state will evaluate the computer typewriting courses started in these institutes and then decide on whether manual typewriting courses should continue,? the state government said in a circular.Maharashtra had over 3,500 typing and shorthand training institutes in which over 7 lakh students took the Government Certificate in Computer Typing Basic Course (GCC-TBC) every year. The test helped evaluate the students? typing skills and the certification came in handy when people applied for government jobs.However, with typewriters becoming outmoded and almost redundant, the government was keen to shut down the course. ?Typewriting machines are outdated, manufacturers have shut shop and there are no spare parts available in market.

'Microsoft 365, which is a new solution from the software giant has been showcased for the Indian market. Microsoft 365 aims to combine Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise mobility as one complete package for enterprises, small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India. The idea with Microsoft 365 is to allow enterprises to have more control over their data, ensure seamless setting up for employees and streamline the IT management system as a whole.According to a Microsoft study called Workplace 2020, more and more employees are using their own devices and also checking personal emails on company-issued devices, which increases potential security risks. Additionally the study showed that many IT based device manufacturers (67 per cent) felt there was a need to reduce complexity of managing of IT security.The idea with Microsoft 365 is to provide all tools from the company under one package to an enterprise and SME. Microsoft 365 can allow for one solution to ensure setting up of company-issued devices with the right data policies, as well as deploy these policies to personal devices.?As the workplace is transforming?from changing employee expectations, to more diverse and globally distributed teams, we are seeing a new culture of work emerging. We are incredibly enthusiastic about Microsoft 365 and how it will help customers and partners drive growth and innovation to embrace this modern culture of work,? said Alok Lall, Partner Technology Lead, Microsoft India.Microsoft will offer this tool in three SKUs: Microsoft 365 Enterprise is geared for bigger companies, Microsoft 365 Business is meant for SMBs, while Microsoft 365 Firstline is meant for the firstline worker, those in customer service or those on the production line. The company plans to charge Rs 661 per user per month from companies that opt for the Microsoft 365 product.?Most enterprises or SMEs don?t have resources that are plenty. So then how can we help people achieve more, no matter what the device be it Android or iOS or whatever browser you are using. So we have something called ?Always-on? Security which goes beyond traditional security like say a firewall at work. We also offer simplification of business, where a company can set up/ onboard their employee in just 10 minutes,? explains Lall.The idea with ?Always-on? security is that with Microsoft 365 the IT admin can simply enable policies for even personal devices and protect important company data. So even if the device is lost or stolen, the company data will get wiped automatically, thus ensuring less data risk for companies. The policies can also allow for restrictions on copy-pasting of company data.Microsoft 365 can also be used to deploy Windows 10 via a new Windows Autopilot capability. This would allow the company?s policies, settings to be deployed on a new employee?s laptop and of this is done via the cloud server. ?The advantage with this is that I can just ship the laptop to my remote worker in say Ghaziabad. He just logs in with this employee id and the settings are automatically applied. So the person does not even have to come to office to set up. Now any Windows 10 device can be ready with this feature,? explained Lall.',real

'Book: Bombay Fever\r\nAuthor: Sidin Vadukut\r\nPublication: Simon & Schuster\r\nPages: 371 pages\r\nPrice:? 350The notion of a deadly plague sweeping through the land has long provided fodder for creativity. In Bombay Fever, Sidin Vadukut takes this all-too-believable genre and adapts it smartly to an Indian context, despite some shortcomings in terms of plausibility and style.A chance encounter in a foreign land leads to the birth of a contagion that soon grows to terrorise India. Struggling in the midst of a rapidly deteriorating society, a diverse group of people ranging from medical workers to doctors without licenses must attempt to make sense of a disease that proves to be as baffling as it is dangerous. Backed by the premise of drug-resistant diseases ? a growing fear in modern society ? the book attempts a broad depiction of the growth and spread of a contagion, and the ensuing reactions.The strength of Bombay Fever is the lack of a central protagonist, with a sufficiently broad narrative vantage point. It hops from character to character with commendable fluidity, fleshing out its world with each new perspective. There are, of course, a handful of characters whose points of view are visited more often, but progress often comes from minor and seemingly unexpected corners, including, at one point, mass-forwarded messages on social media. This makes the unspooling of the plot much more organic, though certain incidents teeter between believable and convenient. The sheer scope of the story necessitates putting an abrupt end to certain characters or plot threads, but such conclusions do not come across as gratuitous.',real

'A neighbor?s account indicates that a Northern California shooter who killed five people this week may have targeted an elementary school as part of his long-running feud with neighbors.Shooter Kevin Neal threatened out loud that he was going to kill Danny Elliott and then go to the elementary school to kill Elliott?s 7-year-old son, said Johnny Phommathep, a neighbor who lived about 200 feet away from Neal.He?d scream to him, ?I?ma kill you, boy. I?ma learn you. Once I kill you, I?ma go kill your son at school,? Phommathep told the Record Searchlight of Redding.The Tehama County Sheriff?s Office said Neal, 44, killed neighbor Danny Elliott and his mother, Diana Steele, in an apparent act of revenge before he shot randomly into vehicles and at people in this tiny, rural community about 130 miles (209 kilometers) north of Sacramento.Neal killed five people and wounded at least a dozen adults and children before authorities shot him dead during a rampage on Tuesday.The gunman rammed a car into the gates of Rancho Tehama Elementary School and shot at its portable classrooms. He tried repeatedly to get into a kindergarten classroom but quick-thinking staff had locked the school down, and he eventually stormed off.Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston has said he wasn?t sure why Neal headed to the school, but Phommathep said Neal probably went there looking for Elliott?s son. The school has about 100 students, in kindergarten through fifth grades.Tehama County District Attorney Gregg Cohen also said through a spokeswoman Friday that he believes Neal targeted the school because of the child.Authorities found the bullet-riddled body of Neal?s wife under the floorboards of their home. They believe her slaying was the start of the rampage.Barbara Glisan was a North Carolina native who loved adventure, said Lesa Caves, a former college roommate. Caves said they once rode a roller coaster 10 times to get the perfect automated snapshot: Hands in the air, big smiles.They lost touch over the years but Caves, 37, said that about a year ago, Glisan started getting back in touch with friends from North Carolina.?She tried to reach out and reconnect with multiple people she had lost contact with,? Caves said. Phommathep?s wife and three of her children are among those wounded.Tiffany Phommathep, 31, was on her way to drop off their children at school when Neal pulled up next to her and sprayed bullets into her pickup. She told reporters from her hospital bed that she was hit four times in the back and shoulder and once in the stomach.She said she asked four people for help but none did. One woman told her she ?couldn?t help me because she only had a two-seater and she was late for work,? Phommathep said. ?That hurt my heart a lot to hear her say that.?Johnston, the assistant sheriff, came across her and helped her, her husband said.At the time of the assault, Neal was out of custody on bail after being arrested in January and charged with stabbing Elliott?s girlfriend. She obtained a restraining order against Neal in February, stating that the household required protection.David Steele, who is Diana Steele?s stepson, said his father Bob is devastated. ?If you have a restraining order on someone like that, he shouldn?t even be allowed to live in the area,? he said.',real

'The ousted mayor of Caracas pledged to spread his protest against Venezuela?s socialist government across the world as he arrived in Spain on Saturday, a day after escaping from house arrest and slipping past Venezuelan security forces into Colombia.Antonio Ledezma?s flight from Bogota landed at Barajas airport in Spain?s capital, Madrid. With a Venezuelan flag draped over his shoulder, he hugged his wife and two daughters and said he would fight Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from exile?I am going to dedicate myself to traveling the world, to spread the hope of all Venezuelans to escape this regime, this dictatorship,?

Ledezma said. ?We don?t have any resources left, only our morale.?Ledezma told The Associated Press on Friday that his decision to flee was driven by threats intended to force the opposition to resume negotiations with Maduro?s government. Fellow opposition leader and former cellmate Leopoldo Lopez remains under house arrest in Venezuela.After slipping past intelligence police officers stationed outside his residence 24 hours a day, he passed through several police checkpoints in a long journey by car to Colombia. Colombian immigration authorities said Ledezma entered the country legally across the Simon Bolivar Bridge.Ledezma, who thanked both Spanish and Colombian authorities for what he described as their warm welcomes, was elated after his escape.?I?ve lived out a James Bond movie,? he said. ?I made this route of more than 24 hours, passing 29 control points, checkpoints, crossing paths, accepting all the risks, and in every moment I always thought about the value of freedom.?',real
'The Ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, ?You cannot step into the same river twice.? He meant to warn us about constant change. Nothing can be taken for granted. The past is an imperfect guide to the future. This is the lesson the BJP has to keep in mind from now till June 2019. Until August 15, Narendra Modi seemed to be dominating politics totally. It seemed 2019 was in the bag with the only question being how much bigger would the BJP?s majority be. Since then, the clouds have darkened a bit. It began with the debacle of Ram Rahim and the failure of the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana to protect its citizens. Yogi Adityanath has created as many controversies as he could within six months of becoming Chief Minister.But those states are not going to the polls this side of 2019. It is the journey from now to the general election (whenever Narendra Modi chooses to hold it) which has to be carefully watched. There are dangers along the way. Take the Gujarat elections to begin with. Given the impressive record Narendra Modi had established over his three victories, it would be difficult for the BJP to do better. The chief minister is almost anonymous; Amit Shah and Modi have taken over the campaign.Remember the Delhi election of 2015? Then the BJP relied totally on Modi?s face on posters delivering victory. It paid a heavy price. It is also interesting to see the agitation being stirred up about Padmavati. If there are still BJP leaders who think that delaying the date of release of the film has any relevance, they need to step into the 21st Century. You can already watch the songs online. If the film is delayed in release, someone would no doubt put a pirated copy online. The days of depriving people of access to information by government order are long gone. Of course, the purpose of the agitation is merely to inflame sections of voters. That is a double-edged sword; you cannot control whom it will hurt.Gujarat has also seen the relaunch of Rahul Gandhi as the leader who is ready to deliver success. Since he spoke in Berkeley, California, two months ago, Rahul Gandhi seems a different person. From then to the publication of an article in the Op-Ed page of the Financial Times on November 8 tells us he has come a long way. Rahul Gandhi appears to have acquired an able group of advisers who are helping him improve his image. His tweets have landed blows because he chooses to mock the Prime Minister as often as earlier he used to angrily denounce him.',real
'Padmavati is your most ambitious project so far in terms of scale. What does it mean to you?It?s wonderful not just for me, but for women in cinema in general, considering the kind of budget woman-centric films have had in India. I?m extremely proud of the fact that today I?m in a place where producers (Viacom 18 and Bhansali Productions) not just trust me but cast me in a movie that primarily revolves around the life of a woman character. I have acted in woman-centric movies earlier, too, such as Piku. None of them were like this in terms of scale.What did you find fascinating about the character of Padmavati?I look at it through two different lenses. As an actor, I am excited about her strength and courage. I have played strong women characters in some of my films and each one of them is identifiable ? be it Naina from Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), Veronica in Cocktail (2012) or Mastani in Bajirao Mastani. All of them have a mind of their own. Same goes for Padmavati. Today?s generation can relate to her courage. For me, the fact that such a film is made and supported is very empowering. Its first poster featured me as Padmavati. I have not seen that in a long time.How much investment in terms of time and energy have you made?A lot. While we were shooting for Bajirao Mastani, one day Sanjay Leela Bhansali asked me: ?What are you doing next year? Keep your dates aside as I?m thinking of doing a movie on Padmavati.? So, this kind of started brewing some three years ago. A large part of the preparation for a film is a mental process. For me, it is not so much about going for diction classes or learning the dance moves ? those are simpler. What?s important for me is that one is completely consumed by the character.What kind of challenges did it pose for you as an actor?It is weird that every time I talk about a movie, I feel that it is the most difficult role I have played. I have to say that again with Padmavati. I will work on my next (a movie produced by Vishal Bhardwaj on a gangster, Sapna Didi) in February. Everyone has been asking me why I am taking a long break before that. But I need that time off. Padmavati has taken so much from me ? physically and emotionally ? that I need time to rejuvenate and feel like myself again before I slip into another role.How affected were you by the controversies around the film during its making?We are extremely proud and confident of the film we have made. When the heart is in the right place, no one can stop a film. While working on the film, as artistes, we were in a different zone. I only spoke up last month after I finished the film and came out of that zone (she reacted to a group of protester in Surat damaging a rangoli inspired by Padmavati). That?s when I wondered for how long are we going to remain silent? For how long would the entertainment industry be made a scapegoat for everything that happens in this country? I believe we are constantly answerable to everyone for some reason or the other. Why attack cinema which is full of love and which brings people together? Why curb people?s freedom of expression? How long can we allow some people to get away with what they have been doing?When you know someone in a certain way, to turn that dynamic on its head is quite challenging. We didn?t meet during the shoot. We didn?t have any idea about what the other person was doing.This is your third film with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh. Ranveer and you played passionate lovers in the first two (Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela, 2013, and, Bajirao Mastani). In Padmavati, you don?t even share the screen with him.It is very weird! Sanjay sir brought the two of us together for two love stories and then he decided to put us in some kind of hate story. We are almost like the beauty and the beast in Padmavati.You do a Chennai Express (2013) and then Finding Fanny (2014). How do you choose your projects?The choice is instinctive. But I wish to keep the excitement alive. I find it very thrilling to get into different characters every six months. Even while picking my scripts, I follow my instincts. I am not looking at churning out X number of movies, but I want to do quality work. If I don?t like something, I won?t take it up. That?s something I?m never going to change. So, sometimes, there could be four films of mine in a year or just one.This is your 10th year in the industry. How would you say the journey has been so far?I have got way more than I had ever imagined. I also know that it is a result of my commitment, hard work and dedication. It has not happened overnight. Only my family, my team and I know what kind of effort it has taken. At the same time, I?m not complaining. I love what I do.Which are the movies that became turning points in your career?Om Shanti Om (2007) definitely is one. Very few actresses would have had that kind of debut. Even today when I step out, people call me Shantipriya. After Om Shanti Om, there was Love Aaj Kal (2009) and Cocktail.Cocktail consolidated your position as an actor. But was that the outcome of the hard work you put in the preceding years?Hard work is constant and consistent. When people don?t like a film, it does not mean that hard work has not gone into it. Maybe we had not identified with what was being done. I have learnt on the job, evolved as a person and all that has made me the actor I am today.Did you struggle to fit into the industry?I would not say it was hard. However, I had created a certain pressure for myself. It was my own assumption that one has to look a certain way or conduct oneself in a certain manner until I realised that the best way is to be myself. That came after my on-the-field experience as well as through my share of ups and downs. I understood that there is a stereotype but I don?t have to make an effort to fit into that.Have your looks ever worked to your disadvantage?They can be a disadvantage. I have been told that I was not offered some projects because I?m good-looking. A director I have worked with a couple of times told me: ?You are too good-looking for this part. It does not work for the story.? I have never really understood what that means. (After a pause) I find that?s a director?s shortcoming. If the director knows that I have the ability to deliver, then he should also know that I would have the ability to transform myself physically to essay that character.You call yourself a shy and private person. How do you handle the public scrutiny of your life?That?s what I am. I understand the public interest in my life, but I find it hard to deal with. At the same time, I have chosen to be in a field where it is part of what I do. So, I have come to terms with it. I would like to believe that I handle it well now. I am still awkward in large gatherings. But, if I can?t make conversation, I don?t put any pressure on myself. Besides, I don?t want to announce on social media what my mood is like or what I?m having for breakfast.Earlier, you often spoke about your personal life, but now, you seem to be a lot more restrained about what you share?There is no formula to that either. There are some parts of my life I would like to keep to myself. The rest is in the public domain. I may choose not to talk about certain things, but I don?t hide anything either.What led you to speak about your depression?When I got better, something told me that I needed to share my experience. I am happy to see how the conversation around mental health has changed. We are acknowledging the condition and addressing it. Though the stigma attached to it still exists and we have a long way to go, people are actually observing Mental Health Day!Was it cathartic?I feel liberated today ? I had caged it up within me for so many months. I could not understand what was happening to me. Since I am open about it, everyone knows what I have been through. Maybe a part of me felt responsible to help other people as there is a lack of awareness regarding it. Often, there is a conflict over what is going on in one?s mind. After I spoke up, at least some people jumped that phase. They can identify the symptoms. For me, recognising these symptoms was the hardest part. Getting over it was easier.When you take a break between projects, what do you generally do?I?m with my family. With them, it is more about doing things together like every other family. That keeps me grounded.When all of you get together, are there frequent badminton games?I have recently started playing badminton again. My racquets were rusting and the shuttles were getting musty. I play downstairs in my building in the evening.Both your sister Anisha (she is a golfer) and you went on to make unusual career choices. What prompted your choices?We made our own career choices because our parents gave us wings to fly. They did not burden us with their expectations. That?s what my grandparents did with my parents. My parents have given us a normal and disciplined childhood without much luxury, like any other middle-class family. My sister and I are different from each other. My parents could see that and encouraged it. I was inclined to the creative world. My sister, on other hand, is extremely calm and intelligent. She has become her own beautiful person today. A large part of my success is because my parents have been so supportive.You are often spotted hanging out with other film personalities. What?s your social life like?I am extremely grateful that I always had very supportive co-stars, directors and producers. The unfortunate fact about being an actor is that we are like nomads ? we are constantly moving from one place to another. We build a life with a certain group of people when we work on a film, but just when we are emotionally getting comfortable, it is taken away from us. We move on to our next film and start the same process all over again. The good thing is that all of us are supportive of each other and we make the effort to stay in touch.Recently, some female actors have talked about the exploitation and harassment they faced or face in the industry. You were an outsider when you came in. Did you face any such problem?I can only speak from my experience. Being an outsider, I was always told that Bollywood is equal to a casting couch. I have been very fortunate not to have experienced it. I am made to feel extremely safe and comfortable. But, perhaps, that?s not the case with other people.I can see Willie Harcourt-Cooze?s Chocolate Bible in your living room. Are you a chocolate person?I am a baking person. I enjoy cooking, but I love baking more. I bake quite often. Over the years, I have picked up books during my travels that mean something to me. Right now, this book is a display piece. Hopefully, it will soon make its way into my kitchen.People?s ChoiceDeepika is undoubtedly an amazing actor and an equally gorgeous person. I have always found her to be grounded, warm and gracious. Her success itself is an inspiring story. She is simple and honest and approaches each role with great intelligence. ? Honey Trehan, director of her next filmDeepika?s upbringing has given her a lot of discipline and the ability to work hard. She is obviously talented, but after Cocktail, she has been unstoppable. She has made brilliant choices by picking up different kinds of roles and by making them work for her. ? Dinesh Vijan, producer-director',real
'Breaking her silence on the Padmavati row, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has written a letter to Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Smriti Irani, urging that the movie not be released without ?necessary changes?. She said a committee with ?famous historians, film personalities and members of the aggrieved community? should be constituted to discuss the movie?s story in detail.In a statement released on Saturday, Raje?s office said that she wrote a letter to Irani ?urging her that the movie should not be released till necessary changes are made so that sentiments of any community are not hurt?. The movie is scheduled for release on December 1.Raje also asked the Censor board to think of all the outcomes before certifying the movie, and said that once a committee such as the one she suggested had discussed the film in detail, ?appropriate changes? could be made. In Indore, Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot asked the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to cut ?objectionable? scenes in Padmavati. ?Anger is palpable in the country over this movie.

'Book: The Whole Shebang: Sticky Bits of Being a Woman\r\nAuthor: Lalita Iyer\r\nPublication: Bloomsbury India\r\nPages: 168?\r\nPrice: Rs 350The sub title of the book reads Sticky Bits of Being a Woman. Indeed, Lalita?Iyer has not spared any of the sticky bits, and some more, in this anthology of essays written in a chatty, breezy style. Part memoir, part self help and all funny, it?s something that most women will relate to. Iyer?s book was born out of the columns that she wrote for a various publications and magazines. The book begins with?Iyer?sharing all the troubles she had to face to find the right underwear. With brutal honesty she talks about navigating thongs and how she wishes grandma underwear to be back in vogue. With similar poignancy sex, career, fashion, body image, motherhood and love are discussed. Financial independence has a whole chapter.Iyer resorts to personal experiences, comparing and contrasting them to comment on the society at large ? and that is what lifts this book up from others in the genre. She talks about her childhood, growing up in?Mumbai?in a south Indian household; and her experiments with dating, men, various jobs and even her hair ? which has transitioned from thick curls to a pixie cut now: liberal reminders of that one friend we all have had.The book has a generous dose of pop culture: Tinder, Facebook, Manolo Blahniks make appearences. References to kitchen ingredients, your wardrobe and even your bathroom are used to define relationships. While talking of men, Iyer writes, ?Every man wants to be a conditioner, but whether they like it or not, quite a few men have to do the dirty work of a shampoo.?There is some philosophy as well. About love, the malady that has ailed one and all, she says, ?Maybe love is one of those vestigial organs, like the appendix, or the male nipple, that evolution is teaching us to live without.?',real

'The Railways will soon send a detailed report to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre on the damage done to the Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR), popularly known as the toy train service, during the recent Gorkhaland agitation.Two stations of DHR ? a world heritage site ? were burnt and ransacked during the 104-day long agitation in the Hills. Other stations were also partially damaged. The report will contain information about all stations, tracks and personnel.UNESCO has already expressed concern over incidents of arson having affecting the DHR and had even written to the Centre.Built between 1879 and 1881, the DHR is a 2-feet narrow-gauge railway which runs between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling (87 km). India?s highest railway station in Ghum, is part of this network. The rail line has a total of six zig zags and five loops and its highest point is at 2,200 m (7,218 ft), in Darjeeling. A major tourist attraction, the DHR got its heritage tag from UNESCO in 1999.A UNESCO team, which was forced to return from Darjeeling as the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) led agitation started, will be revisiting Darjeeling shortly.?We have asked for a detailed report from DHR regarding the damages and present condition. The report will be sent to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre through the union cultural ministry,? said Subrata Nath, executive director heritage (Railway Board), speaking to The Indian Express from New Delhi.?I do not think the world heritage tag is in danger.

'Light rain early on Saturday morning brought Delhi?s air quality to ?poor? ? an improvement from the ?very poor? and ?severe? levels that the city witnessed last week. This is the first time since October 16 that ?poor? air quality was recorded in the city. According to officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Safdarjung observatory saw 1 mm of rain between 2 am and 4 am on Saturday. Data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee station at Mandir Marg, which is closest to the observatory, shows that PM (particulate matter) 2.5 levels shot up to 249 ?g/m3 at 3 am and came down to 172 ?g/m3 at 4 am. Around 4 pm, the concentration was down to 105 ?g/m3.Air quality is usually better in the afternoon as compared to the night as temperature and wind speed during the day are higher. The acceptable limit of PM 2.5 is 60 ?g/m3. Over the past week, the Delhi Fire Services and the municipal corporations have tried to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the air by spraying water from a height to mimic rain. At ITO, the move did not have too much of an impact.According to data by the Central Pollution Control Board, while PM 2.5 was around 110 ?g/m3 before sprinkling 70,000 litres of water, it came down to 106 at 4 pm. It was recorded at 129 ?g/m3 at 5 pm, and shot up above 200 ?g/m3 at 11 pm, showing almost negligible gains.

'Beginning this week, visitors to Raj Bhavan, the residence of the Maharashtra Governor in Malabar Hill, have been able to roam around its famed walking trail in a solar, battery-operated car. The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation acquired a small vehicle after Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao decided that visitors should have the option of an additional mode of transport.?The Governor introduced solar-powered vehicles in Tamil Nadu when he was holding charge there. He decided to introduce them here as well,? says Umesh Kashikar, the Governor?s spokesperson. Earlier this week, the first batch of visitors was able to experience Raj Bhavan?s ecology seated in the 15-seater car.?Earlier, whenever we received old visitors who were not able to walk through the whole trail, we would take them around in our own battery operated car. But that one is very small and can only seat four people,? said Kashikar, adding that with the new car, elderly visitors are able to take in all the sights. The two-and-a-half-kilometre trail begins at the 150-foot tall tricolour and a lawn where the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru unveiled the map of Maharashtra in 1950. The car then makes its way past a narrow road with sloping hills on one side and the sea on another, as signs reminding drivers that the speed limit is 20 kilometres per hour flash by. Pointing to another sign, Kashikar says, ?Nowhere else will you read a road sign that says ?drive slowly and be careful of peacocks?.?The vehicle stops at a specially designed peacock enclosure called Mayur Vihar. ?It is very hard to spot peacocks here unless you arrive early morning. They do not stay in the enclosure and move about,? says Kashikar. The car?s rectangular dimensions prevent it from moving forward on to the final stretch that opens into Raj Bhavan?s rear entrance. ?The car can go ahead, but it won?t be able to turn back,? explains Kashikar. Instead, the vehicle takes visitors to the final stops on the trail, an elevated deck called the Sunrise Point that offers panoramic views.?We lay mats here for early morning visitors who want to practise yoga,? he says.',real

'Pinning the responsibility on consumer goods companies for reduction in prices following the recent cut in GST rates, finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia on Saturday said that the companies have to ensure an immediate cut in prices across the retail chain to avoid facing anti-profiteering action by the government.?The company, which is selling products with MRP, has to ensure that its entire chain of wholesalers, retailers are informed and has to ensure that after November 15, the retailer charges MRP after taking into consideration the reduction in tax rate from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. This is very important. That?s why I again want to appeal to FMCG companies that if they want to be safe from anti-profiteering action then they have to ensure that their whole retail chain is informed?? Adhia, who also holds the charge of revenue secretary, told Doordarshan News.On restaurants raising prices even after a reduction in tax rate to 5 per cent, Adhia said that if there are genuine cases of input cost going up, they are free to increase prices, if it is permitted by competition. He said that as per the earlier GST rates of 18 per cent and 12 per cent for AC and non-AC restaurants, respectively, along with input tax credits, restaurants were told to cut prices. Though some big restaurant chains did so, there were some complaints from consumers for facing the entire burden of taxation, he added.?The complaints against restaurants were that they imposed 18 per cent on menu price. This used to disturb consumers? some restaurants had to take huge credit for inputs because they have their commercial premises on lease but 90 per cent of restaurants were such who need not take much ITC because the items used are either in nil or 5 per cent tax slab? so, 5 per cent was decided without input tax credit. So that the blame of increase in price does not come on the government.After 5 per cent tax if any restaurant wants to increase their prices because their input cost has gone up, then they are free to do it if the competition permits. Because restaurant sector is mostly covered by competition. Keeping all this in mind we have decided this (5 per cent GST rate) and I think very few anti-profiteering action will be required on restaurants,? he said.The GST Council had last week announced a cut in the rates of over 200 items, as well as a cut in the GST rate for all restaurants, barring those in starred hotels, to 5 per cent. Rates of 178 items, mostly consumer items of daily use, were reduced from the highest tax slab of 28 per cent to 18 per cent. The new GST rates came into effect from Wednesday.Adhia said that even though the consumer affairs ministry has given time till December 31 for revision in MRP, the FMCG companies should ensure an immediate lowering of prices.?Yesterday (Friday), the consumer affairs ministry has allowed price revision till December but that does not mean that they do it any time till December. Price revision has to be done in one day. Even if it takes time to out revised label, the benefit to consumers has to be given immediately,? he said. Adhia added FMCG firms should advertise revised prices in newspapers.On concerns over small businesses coming under the lens of anti-profiteering authority, he said the authority will take action only against big organised sector companies. He added, ?It might have happened that their cost has gone up genuinely by 2-3 per cent, but if there is a gap of 10 per cent in price, then the consumer should get to see the reduction. Don?t want any trouble for any industry but at the same time consumers should benefit.?',real
'Bundesliga top scorer Robert Lewandowski struck twice as champions Bayern Munich eased past Augsburg 3-0 on Saturday to make it eight wins in eight games in all competitions under coach Jupp Heynckes and open up a six-point lead at the top of the table.Lewandowski, sporting a new, peroxide-blond hairstyle, grabbed Bayern?s second goal not long after Arturo Vidal?s 31st-minute opener and added another early in the second half, to take his league tally to 13 goals.The Poland striker has now scored 18 times against Augsburg in 13 Bundesliga matches, more than against any other club. The Bavarians, who have not dropped a point since Heynckes took over from Carlo Ancelotti last month, are top on 29, six ahead of RB Leipzig who drew 2-2 at Bayer Leverkusen. It was also Heynckes? 500th Bundesliga win as coach and player, extending his own record.Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga leaders only a few weeks ago, are in complete free fall, having dropped to third on 20 after their 2-1 loss at VfB Stuttgart on Friday, their fourth league defeat in their last five matches.Augsburg were bold and matched Bayern for half an hour before Vidal turned and fired in from close range for the lead. The Chilean then sent Lewandowski through with a defence-splitting pass to double it.The Pole then volleyed in a perfect Joshua Kimmich cross four minutes after the restart to knock their opponents out in a perfect dress rehearsal for their Champions League match at Anderlecht next week.Leverkusen proved too hard to crack for Leipzig as they came from a goal down twice to earn a point, with Kevin Volland netting the final equaliser in the 74th minute. Leverkusen played most of the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Benjamin Henrichs.VfL Wolfsburg notched their first win under coach Martin Schmidt following seven successive draws, beating Freiburg 3-1 to climb to 13th.',real
'A leading figure among religious liberals says the candidacy of Republican Roy Moore for US Senate is a struggle for the ?soul of the nation.?The remarks Saturday by the Rev. William J. Barber come a day after a letter signed by dozens of progressive pastors in Alabama said Moore _ dogged by recent allegations of inappropriate conduct toward teenage girls decades ago _ is unfit to serve.Barber, former head of the North Carolina NAACP, spoke at an anti-Moore rally at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that drew more than 100 people. The event was in direct contrast to a news conference Thursday during which religious conservatives expressed their commitment to Moore, who describes himself as a conservative Christian who hews to family values.Signs carried by Moore opponents at Saturday?s rally decried his opposition to gay and transgender rights. Moore was also criticized for opposing federally backed health care, assistance for the needy and more.Barber and other speakers claimed Moore?s campaign is fueled by a perversion of Christianity linked with white supremacy, and Moore is trying to take those forces to the Senate.?What is happening now in Alabama matters for the soul of the nation,? said Barber, of Goldsboro, North Carolina, and the force behind the ?Moral Monday? protest movement that calls for greater rights for gays and minorities.On Friday, more than 50 Alabama pastors signed a public letter stating Moore isn?t fit to serve in the US Senate. The letter continued to collect signatures Saturday.The letter says Moore demonstrated ?extremist values? incompatible with traditional Christianity even before recent allegations of sexual misconduct involving young women.The pastors cite Moore?s opposition to the expansion of Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor. It also accuses him of denigrating people from other countries and faiths and cites his opposition to homosexuality.The letter was written by a group of pastors in Birmingham. It includes the signatures of ministers from mainstream and liberal denominations including Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, the United Church of Christ and some moderate Baptists.Moore still enjoys the support of conservative evangelical leaders, but he has ignored mounting calls from Washington Republicans concerned that if he stays in the race he may not only lose a seat they were sure to win but also may do significant damage to the party?s brand among women nationwide as they prepare for a difficult midterm election season.Since last week, Moore has been engulfed by accusations of sexual misconduct toward women in their teens when he was a deputy district attorney in his 30s. Several of his accusers have allowed their identities to be made public.One said Moore molested her when she was 14. Another said Moore assaulted her when she was a 16-year-old waitress after he offered to drive her home. Five others said Moore pursued romantic relationships with them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.',real

'Book- Hema Malini: Beyond the Dream Girl?\r\nAuthor-Ram Kamal Mukherjee??\r\nPublisher- Harper Collins?\r\nPages- 241\r\nPrice- Rs 599If you thought that Hema Malini: Beyond The Dream Girl, an authorised biography by Ram Kamal Mukherjee would, perhaps, answer all your questions about the various controversies that have mired the famed actor over decades, you will be sorely disappointed. It?s not a no-holds-barred book. It?s at best a well-written Wikipedia entry.It barely scratches the surface of the story of this Iyengar girl, who spent her initial years ? 14 to be precise ? in Delhi, and then, eventually, moved to Chennai (then Madras).?The biography traverses the predictable path of recounting Hema?s childhood years, strict Tamilian upbringing under the watchful eyes of her mother Jaya Chakravarti and her rigorous Bharatnatyam training.The transition from a stage performer to her film debut opposite Raj Kapoor in Sapno Ka Saudagar is all chronicled, but what is missing is the human element. What did a 16-year-old girl, who was making her debut opposite the biggest name in the industry at the time, feel about how fast her life was changing? Did she struggle with her strong Tamil accent in what was a predominantly Hindi speaking industry? What we get instead is a gilded portrait of an actor and a highly accomplished performer, who never fumbles and is praised by all.The much talked-about scandal ? her marriage to superstar Dharmendra, who was already married, is also kept under the carpet. While the love and affection the two share is brought out in the open, their courtship and wedding get no mention.If you pay attention closely, though, the book is good for filmi trivia. One gets to know that the famous comic scene from Sholay ? where Amitabh Bachchan advertises Dharmendra?s viability as a groom to Basanti?s maternal aunt, is inspired from a real life incident. Javed Akhtar, who co-wrote the film with Salim Khan, wished to marry Honey Irani.Khan was dispatched to Irani?s family to win them over for Akhtar. Apparently, Khan kept singing praises of Akhtar and undercutting him at the same time. In the book, there?s also a mention of how Jeetendra was supposed to marry Hema, but, ultimately, married his long-time girlfriend Shobha, instead.',real
'Title: How To Travel Light\r\nAuthor: Shreevatsa Nevatia\r\nPublisher: Penguin Random House\r\nPages: 248\r\nPrice: Rs 399When a bouncer and a doctor barge into Shreevatsa Nevatia?s bedsit to take him away to rehab, he grabs a copy of Karl Ove Knausgaard?s Boyhood Island to take with him. At the rehab, he lends the copy to a fellow inmate who returns it the next day saying: ?Honesty is boring, man.?Nevatia epigraphs his book with a Raymond Carver quote: ?Write about what you know, and what do you know better than your own secrets?? Nevatia?s secret is his bipolar condition, and he writes of it with unflinching honesty, an honesty that is lacerating, entertaining even, but never boring. That the writing bores into you like an electric drill is a different matter altogether.?The highs and the lows/ And the to?s and the fro?s/ They left me dizzy?, sang Pete Doherty in ?I No Longer Hear the Music?. In How to Travel Light, Nevatia describes both the delusions of mania and the inevitable crash that follows in clear, unadorned prose. This is a beautifully structured, skilfully nuanced and flamboyantly written book. It?s the message in the bottle that?s washed up on the shore, after the turbulent waves have receded.Nevatia uses cinema, literature and Hindu mythology to come to terms with his condition. Shiva stands for anarchic lucidity. Vishnu brings order. Literature is as important as lithium in the Nevatian scheme of things.He examines an episode of childhood trauma when he is sexually abused, over a period of time, by a family member without sentimentality or judgement. He is uneasy with easy cause and effect scenarios. There is clarity in ambiguity.He describes doctors both good and bad, rehabs that are like ?dictatorial kindagartens?, where social workers come to test the general knowledge of inmates (one test involves naming India?s state capitals) and therapists who think his problem will be solved by reading Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. But the writer is on a level a few notches higher. As he?s dragged to a doctor for the umpteenth time, he enters the clinic raging: ?So, what?s it going to be today? Freud, Lacan, Jung??When having a manic episode, he becomes a smooth operator with women, enters Internet chat rooms with multiple fake identities and spends money like water, once buying two hundred pounds worth of books as a student in England. He leaves the choice of books to the assistant who happily introduces him to the Complete Stories of Flannery O? Connor, among others.He leaves 56 posts in 24 hours on his Facebook wall, feels he?s being followed by intelligence agencies and when hospital bouncers come to get him, is convinced that they have been sent by Narendra Modi. He colour codes his books: ?To mark something vital, I used my purple pen. If I came across prose I envied, I brought out my pink highlighter. Black was used in the margins of books, and green always meant ?rework?.?Nevatia writes with tenderness about his relationship with his parents, the helpless cycle of anger, outburst, remorse and crippling guilt. As the book ends we find him in a better place, aided by friends, family, medication and therapy: ?There was suddenly more joy in the mundane than there was in Kafka. I grew averse to drama. The turbulent events of my life were best related with a smirk. Almost 10 years after I had been diagnosed as bipolar, I was no longer a victim of my affliction.?',real
'Even as protests by farmers ebbed in most parts of the state, the confrontation between sugar millers and cane growers in Solapur showed no sign of abating, with the growers taking to the streets again to voice their demand. Solapur, the home district of state Minister for Cooperatives Subhash Deshmukh, has been witnessing violence with cane growers disrupting the movement of cane demanding Rs 2,700 as first installment payment.At the start of the crushing season 2017-18, there were reports of violence from several districts of the state, as cane growers locked horns with millers over the first installment payment. In the cane belt of Sangli and Kolhapur, the confrontation was resolved after millers agreed to pay Rs 200 over the fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first installment. During the agitation over FRP earlier this week, two farmers were injured in Ahmednagar, when police fired on the agitators. While the protests have died out in most parts of the state, it continues in Solapur.Ravikant Tupkar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said farmers are asking for Rs 2,700 as the first installment payment. Millers in the region have expressed their inability to pay the amount. Senior millers pointed to the low sugar recovery in the region, which made the payment non-feasible. A meeting between millers and protesting farmers called by the sugar commissioner on Friday failed to resolve the deadlock.',real

'Nisar Ahmed, 15, a rickshaw puller?s son, rewrote the Under-16 national record in the 100 metres with a timing of 10.85 seconds at the 33rd National Junior Athletics Championships. UP?s Rahul Sharma (11.05) and Maharashtra?s Karan Hegiste (11.11s) settled for the silver and bronze medal respectively at the Acharya Nagarjuna University athletics ground in Vijaywada on Saturday.This is not the first time that the Delhi boy has run below 11 seconds. This season he has three sub-11 timings, with his best effort of 10.76s coming at the School Nationals in Bhopal just a fortnight ago. His timings in Vijaywada, however, will be officially ratified by Athletics Federation of India. Ahmed?s gold-medal winning sprint bettered the four-year old record (11.1s) held by AS Arun of Tamil Nadu.Ahmed?s breakout performance came at the Delhi State Athletics meet in September where on the final day he clocked 11 seconds to bag the 100m gold. The victory also drew attention to the plight of the youngster, who lived with his family at the Bada Bagh slum in Azadpur area.Ahmed, believes the Delhi event was the turning point in his life and has spurred him on to break the national record. ?I really want to thank the people who came up to help me after that race. I have improved so much now that I can afford better diet and equipment. I want them to continue to support me and guide me in my journey to become an international athlete,? Ahmed said over the phone.Ahmed says his phone hasn?t stopped ringing since he broke the Under-16 record. The first person to call, as always, was his mother who keenly follows her son?s progress.?I have been talking to her everyday. She tells me that she is praying for me everyday. She was really delighted when I told her about my record,? he says.Ahmed?s mother Shafikunisha, a domestic help, has never witnessed her son race. But the son forwarded a whatsapp video of the record-breaking feat to his mother.Ahmed, who is one of the most promising junior-level athletes in the country at the moment, trains at the Chhatrasal stadium under coach Sunita Rai.At Ahmed?s home, all his medals are kept in a plastic bag and the gold he won on Saturday will go into the same bag.?This has to be the best victory of my life,? he says.After a news report in The Indian Express highlighted Ahmed?s plight in September when he won gold at the state meet, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met him. ?They (government) asked me what I needed in writing.

The announcement was made at the magnificent Bangla Academy here during the closing ceremony of the three-day-long Dhaka Literature Festival on Saturday.?Writers are not race car drivers. We are not in some kind of a race. We are all working in silence, we write because we believe there are things that cannot be communicated in speech. It feels a little insincere to celebrate this award because my novel is about something so tragic,? said dArudpragasam after receiving the award. He announced he would donate one-third of the prize money to the organisations that work in Northern Sri Lanka, to Rohingya Muslims and to Kashmiri organisations providing succour in the troubled state.Apart from ?The Story of a Brief Marriage,? the other four novels in the shortlist were Aravind Adiga?s ?Selection Day?; Anjali Joseph?s ?The Living?; Karan Mahajan?s ?The Association of Small Bombs?; and ?In the Jungles of the Night? by Stephen Alter.Jury chair Ritu Menon described Arudpragasam?s work as a ?remarkable novel?, saying it had ?several exceptional qualities?.?Writers don?t respect national or territorial borders.

'Book: A Tale of Two Victoria Crosses\r\nAuthor: Lt Gen Baljit Singh \r\nPublication: Pentagon Press \r\nPages: 82\r\nPrice: Rs 415Decorated soldiers have a pride of place in regimental histories. Their actions in the face of the enemy are extolled in the war records of the unit which took part in that particular battle and the exploits of such soldiers are used to enthuse new entrants into the regimental fold. A Tale of Two?Victoria?Crosses is a slim but very informative volume by Lt Gen Baljit Singh (retd), formerly of the Regiment of Artillery, primarily about a young infantry lieutenant who lost his place in the annals of the Indian Army despite having been decorated with the?Victoria?Cross (VC), the highest British gallantry award. Lt Karamjeet Singh Judge won the VC posthumously in Burma (now Myanmar) in World War II, while serving with the 4th Battalion of the 15th Punjab Regiment.After Partition, this battalion was allotted to the Pakistan Army, where it was re-named ? it is now the 12 Punjab. The author argues that there are strong leads to suggest that Karamjeet?s company from the erstwhile 4/15 Punjab was transferred to the Sikh Regiment of Indian Army, but this is not recorded in official history. So while the Indian battalions and regiments who took part in the World Wars keep the memories of their decorated soldiers alive, Lt Judge?s battlefield exploits seem to have been lost to history.?Much of the recorded regimental history pertaining to Karamjeet?s Company and the deeds of its individuals got wiped out in the process of the subdivision of the erstwhile monolithic Indian Army,? writes Lt Gen Singh, ?and Karamjeet?s name remains confined almost entirely to the pages of VC history.? Lt Judge?s VC has been reduced to a mere statistic, whereas it should be cherished by both the Indian Punjab Regiment and the 12 Punjab of Pakistan Army, ?because battlefield valour transcends boundaries of friend and foe.?The book is an emotional outpouring of the author, whose first commanding officer, Lt Col Ajit Singh Judge, was the elder brother of Karamjeet. He describes in detail the action in the Battle of Meiktila in which Lt Judge laid down his life and was awarded the VC, and even managed to track down the British tank commander who witnessed the action and wrote the citation for his decoration.An interesting aspect of Lt Gen Baljit Singh?s efforts is the manner in which he links a British officer, Lt John Symth of 15 Sikhs, with Lt Karamjeet Singh Judge. Lt Smyth won his VC in the Battle of Ypres in World War I and according to the author, the young Indian officer and his brother were both inspired to join the Indian Army when they saw a poster depicting Smyth in Jalandhar. ?Chalo, aapaan vi ik-ik?Victoria?Cross lae ke aayiae Bhraah-ji,? (Come, let?s also win a?Victoria?Cross each, brother) Karamjeet is quoted as saying to his brother before signing up for the Army.Coincidentally, Smythe was a major general commanding an infantry division in Burma in the World War II, where the young lieutenant he had inspired was also serving, although in a different theatre. While Lt Judge ultimately won a VC inspired by Smythe, unfortunately, the latter?s military career ended in ignominy when he was divested of his command for an operational failure and reduced from his acting rank of major general to lieutenant colonel.',real
'If you are going through stressful circumstances, it is advisable that you reconsider your decisions once again. People usually tend to make risky and abnormal decisions under chronic stress, a new study has found.Making decisions in this type of situation, known as a cost-benefit conflict, is dramatically affected by chronic stress.The study, published in the journal Cell, states that impairments of a specific brain circuit underlie this abnormal decision making and could further restore normal behaviour by manipulating this circuit.If a method for tuning this circuit in humans were developed, it could help patients with disorders such as depression, addiction, and anxiety, which often feature poor decision-making, the researchers noted.?We found a microcircuit of neurons in the striatum that we could manipulate to reverse the effects of stress on this type of decision making,? said Ann Graybiel, Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, the US.The researchers believe that this circuit integrates information about the good and bad aspects of possible choices, helping the brain to produce a decision.The team conducted a mice study, whereby rodents were allowed to choose between highly concentrated chocolate milk, which they like, under the presence of a bright light, which they don?t, and an option with dimmer light but weaker chocolate milk.Before experiencing stress, normal rats and mice chose to run towards the dimmer light and weaker chocolate milk about half the time. As the researchers gradually increased the concentration of chocolate milk in the dimmer side, the animals began choosing that side more frequently.',real

'Italian football federation (FIGC) president Carlo Tavecchio said he has not slept since Monday?s World Cup elimination which he blamed firmly on coach Gian Piero Ventura.Ventura was sacked on Wednesday, two days after a goalless draw at home to Sweden meant that Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958.Tavecchio, 74, is under pressure to follow suit but has so far stood his ground.?The debacle was technical, the coach made the wrong technical choices,? he said in a trailer for a programme which will be broadcast by the Mediaset network on Sunday.?We played the wrong way; Sweden?s players are nearly all over one metre 90 and we kept crossing the ball into the penalty area.

'Book: Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy\r\nAuthor: Tim Harford\r\nPublication: Little, Brown\r\nPages: 352?\r\nPrice: Rs 599When the makers of our Constitution incorporated Article 48, providing for a ban on the slaughter of cows and their progeny as a non-binding ?directive principle of state policy?, there were a few thousand tractors and probably no power threshers or combine harvesters in use in farms across India. Chemical fertiliser application, too, was hardly 40,000 tonnes a year in nutrient terms, while artificial insemination didn?t extend beyond trials at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly. And most rural homes used dried dung cake as cooking fuel.Cut to the present, where we have tractor sales of 550,000-600,000 and fertiliser nutrient consumption at 27-28 million tonnes annually, while the 70 million-plus artificial inseminations during 2016-17 could theoretically cover over half of the country?s adult female bovine population.All these add up to a huge technological disruption. But more important are its socio-economic and cultural consequences. The cow ? as the source of draught power, fertiliser-cum-fuel and milk ? was an integral part of a largely agriculture-based civilisation. But with the advent of tractors, chemical fertilisers, artificial insemination and LPG cylinders, the gau was reduced to a mere milk-producing machine. The tensions now on the ground, between practical farmers and people violently yearning for an irrecoverable past, are no less a by-product of technology disruption.Tractors, combines, artificial insemination and LPG cylinders don?t figure in Tim Harford?s Fifty Things that Made the Modern Economy, though the Haber-Bosch process ? which, by enabling use of atmospheric nitrogen to make ammonia, paved the way for mineral fertilisers ? does. Some of the things in his list ? infant formula, TV dinners and the pill ? were transformative, no doubt, but perhaps more for women in advanced than in third-world settings. You cannot ultimately divorce technology from the specific contexts in which it is introduced.That tendency to not look beyond the industrialised capitalist world for game-changing innovations ? the now-largely-forgotten C.K. Rajkumar?s idea of selling shampoos in sachets was no less pioneering than Ikea?s Billy bookcase ? shouldn?t, however, take away from the insightfulness of the latest offering from the author of The Undercover Economist. The good part about Fifty Things is its readability; not only can you begin from any chapter, Harford himself follows no chronological order while dealing with the inventions he believes have really made our world today possible. Thus, the chapter on the light bulb comes at the very end, whereas those on the iPhone and Google search feature in the middle and towards the beginning, respectively. Not adhering to a historical timeline, indeed, allows for viewing things for what they are: the plough?s design and power source may have changed, but what it does today isn?t much different from the time when humans first turned from hunter-gatherers into settled agriculturalists.The plough, barbed wire and light bulb were inventions whose utility was immediate and obvious. This wasn?t the case, though, with the shipping container and the barcode. The idea of moving cargo in corrugated steel boxes that fitted neatly onto flatbed trucks and using cranes to lock, lift and load these directly on ships ? as opposed to physical handling of individual goods in general cargo vessels ? was original and elegant. But for it to take off required truckers, shipping companies and ports to come together and agree first on the standards for container sizes. The barcode similarly became a reality only when grocery makers had affixed these machine-readable distinctive black and white stripes on their products. But they wouldn?t do it until the food retailers had installed enough scanners.The same goes for electricity. By the early 1880s, Thomas Alva Edison had already built generating stations. Yet, less than five per cent of mechanical drive power in American factories, even in 1900, was coming from electric motors. The reason: Most factories were still running on steam power. Simply replacing steam engines with electric motors didn?t make sense to owners. Electricity could help raise manufacturing efficiency, but it meant having to change everything, from the production process to factory layout architecture. That happened only towards the late 1910s: ?The thing about a revolutionary technology?, as Harford notes, ?is that it changes everything?. Electricity did precisely that.It follows, then, that no technology can succeed without the willingness of potential users to reorganise their existing systems and processes. The power of a technology becomes evident only with a critical mass of adopters ? who start discovering new ideas and avenues for its exploitation ? and also when it combines with other technologies. Skyscrapers, for instance, were a result of at least three inventions ? the elevator, air-conditioning and reinforced concrete ? coming together. The modern glassy high rises, to quote Harford, would be ?uninhabitable? without the air-conditioner, ?unbuildable? without steel or reinforced concrete, and ?inaccessible? without the elevator.An equally relevant point about inventions, especially today?s, is that they aren?t always the work of just the individuals with whom they are associated. Steve Jobs was a genius, but many of the iPhone?s key technologies ? the internet which makes a smartphone a smartphone, the fast Fourier transform algorithms that swiftly turn analogue signals into digital, the touch screen or even the Siri voice-activated personal assistant ? were originally developed by others, including the US Department of Defence and the European Organisation for Nuclear Research.Nor are the big inventions necessarily things. Harford mentions limited liability companies, double-entry bookkeeping and intellectual property as man-made ideas that were, nevertheless, game-changing. To these, we could add, perhaps, even the goods and services tax (GST) ? the idea of a single national commodities tax levied on a value-added principle, wherein compliance becomes self-policing.Finally, technology creates both winners and losers. In the pre-gramophone era, a singer had to be physically present at a place to be heard. But with sound reproduction technology, her voice could reach a global audience.',real

Already we are getting drones to do the flying over the vineyards, which can tell you which vines need water or treating,? said Joseph, who is a partner at le Grand Noir wines in France.?Machines will do a lot of the judging (wine tasting). They can judge between an OK wine and a not-so-Ok wine pretty effectively,? he said, adding that there would still be scope for human discernment.But wine critics, he said, would be more and more redundant with peer reviews replacing the formal art of wine criticism.?We are going to see different kinds of wines, like fruit-flavoured wines; you will see a lot more wine cocktails. You are going to see packaging changes. Bottles don?t need to be 75 centiliters big. That is the size, because it was the lung capacity of the French glass-blower 300 years ago. There?s no God who defined the size. We are going to see wines in single serves and big bottles,? he said.Joseph also marked out climate change as one of the key challenges for the wine industry, with alterations in weather patterns even possibly threatening the holy turf of wine-making ? France and Italy.?It?s going to be very, very interesting and potentially going to be challenging. In established regions like Bordeaux, Burgundy and Loire, it is questionable whether they are going to be growing the same grapes. That?s a really big question and there is some experimentation going on, but not enough,? he said.Wines from the popular French regions, he said, are already tasting different. ?Grapes are much riper than they used to be. But it?s just not about warming. That means there are going to be places which are going to be warmer, which are not warmer. English wines are starting to benefit already, maybe, Iceland, who knows? That?s a dramatic change. We will see more vineyards going into the hills in lots of places, which includes India,? he said.',real
'It takes some convincing to make Sabi Giri answer that phone. Several WhatsApp messages go unanswered. A scheduled meeting in Delhi is cancelled at the last minute and a Skype conversation is denied (?I don?t want to be seen like this?). One would have tempted to use the word difficult if it were not for the 25-year-old?s predicament: she is fighting a court battle to be reinstated in her job. On October 5, Sabi was discharged by the navy after she underwent a gender reassignment surgery.The Indian navy restricts the recruitment of women to certain departments. Sabi was serving in a position reserved for men, that of a naval sailor. In its response to Sabi?s petition, the Indian navy said that the existing rules of the navy do not allow Sabi?s ?continued employment?. ?The serving sailor ? chose to undergo irreversible gender re-assignment on his own accord whilst on leave wilfully altering his gender status from the one he was recruited for at the time of his induction. He has therefore breached the Recruitment Regulations and eligibility criteria for his employment as a sailor in the Indian navy,? was the Press Information Bureau?s (Defence Wing) official response to the press. On October 31, the Delhi High Court asked the navy to consider giving Sabi a clerical post. Born into a middle-class family in Chapra, Bihar, young Manish was the only teenager in class without a love interest. ?All my friends had girlfriends and boyfriends. I was the odd one out. My mother was very proud that her son had no bad habits,? says Sabi. He knew he was not like the other children. He told himself he was the studious sort and lived with it. ?In college, I was bullied a bit. Boys of that age are quite ruthless. I had a hard time there,? she says. In 2010, Sabi joined the navy; she was 18. ?It was a moment of great pride for my family. A boy in the sena elevates the family?s status in our part of the word,? says Sabi.After she completed her training, she was posted at INS Ganga in Mumbai in 2011. ?That?s where life took a different turn,? says Sabi. ?For the first time in my life, I felt emptiness. It was not so much unhappiness as much as this gnawing feeling of losing out,? says Sabi. Her need to seek out people from the queer community was a ?way to fill in the loneliness.? ?I didn?t even have the vocabulary to define my feelings. Now, I knew there were other people like me,? she said.In her second year in Mumbai, she decided to stay with her friends for about 20 days, without informing her officer in charge. ?I wanted to be free for that time. You don?t know how it feels to rehearse each sentence before actually speaking it. I used to do it so that I didn?t sound too effeminate. It?s like being in a prison,? she says. As a punishment, Sabi alleges she was sent into ?detention? for about three weeks. ?I was not allowed to wear anything but my undergarments. I was locked into a cell and could only go out to relieve myself. Those 20-odd days broke me in many ways,? says Sabi.Eventually, Sabi was transferred to the Visakhapatnam base. By this time, she had a sound network of friends from the queer community. That was also the time she reached out to the navy doctors. ?I told them about the difficulties I was having. I told them that I could no longer identify myself as a man. They referred me for counseling,? says Sabi.The counseling sessions would last about an hour where she says she would be advised to take these things ?in her stride?, she says. Last year, a private psychiatrist and psychologist in Visakhapatnam diagnosed her with gender identity disorder. ?I took a decision to go through a sex reassignment surgery,? says Sabi. The procedure was completed in Delhi last year. ?I rushed back to Vizag because I had exhausted my leave,? says Sabi. The healing period of these procedures at times extend to months. ?Within days of returning, I acquired a urinary tract infection. I was scared and I didn?t know who to confide in,? says Sabi.When the navy doctors got to know about her surgery, they allegedly transferred her to the psychiatric ward as soon her infection was cured. ?For six months, I was kept in the psychiatric ward, with two men keeping watch 24X7,? she says. After she was released from the psychiatric ward in 2017, Sabi reported for work. But she was slapped with a showcause notice for her service record. ?They highlighted my past leave of absence. But the thing is: I was duly punished for all that,? says Sabi.',real
'From styling with chic belts to wearing them in dhoti style, Shilpa Shetty has always been able to give a new meaning to a sari.

Though we like the concept of comfort fashion, we think stylist Mohit Rai went a little overboard with colours. The multitude of stripes and mismatching colours were a little confusing and we think the plain grey trousers and gold pallu awkwardly stood out, without really blending in.For the accessories, Shetty chose a pair of silver hoops with tassels by Suhani Pittie and sandals from Aprajta Toor rounded off her look nicely.

'Theeran Adhigaram Ondru movie cast: Karthi, Rakul Preet Singh, Abhimanyu Singh, Bose Venkat\r\nTheeran Adhigaram Ondru movie director: H Vinoth\r\nTheeran Adhigaram Ondru movie rating: 3 starsWhen I met Director H Vinoth before Theeran Adhigaram Ondru?s release, he told me that the film would be a new experience if we forgive a few clich?s. That is exactly how the movie turned out to be. A high-paced action flick, Theeran Adhigaram Ondru walks the talk in all aspects well aided by Ghibran?s music.The breakneck pace that the film maintains (for the most part) helps us battle the film?s major grouse, it?s running time. Deep into the second half, we can empathise with Karthi?s frustration; we are as annoyed as he is about not being able to nab the gang. But, the well-orchestrated action sequences keep you hooked. We barely see any walking on-screen; even the jeeps and buses ply in fast-forward. There is so much happening that you don?t feel the need to look away or have the space to do so.My conversation with Vinoth kept resurfacing as I watched Theeran Adhigaram Ondru; I was happy that he delivered what he promised. A story about an honest cop, there is a constant reminder about the imperfect mechanism they have to function within. However, there is minimal preaching. Rather, the disappointment is mired in sarcasm. The elements of a regular police story do make an appearance: the cop who always has an easy way out, lack of funds, the references to bribery etc. However, there is no disillusionment in Theeran?s case. He knows what he is up against. Why complain? Karthi delivers a neat performance as Theeran, pulling off the action sequences with elan.The cut to the flashback, or the actual story, is probably the weakest link in Theeran Adhigaram Ondru. A phone call from a younger officer about the most difficult case he had ever handled sets Theeran?s mind in motion, recalling the past. Instead of a cut there, if we could have seen Theeran walking down the memory lane after the phone call, the end would have felt more cohesive. And, going by the low standards set for heroines in commercial films, I was happy Rakul Preet Singh had a role to play, even if it is minor. Yet another take on the ?loose ponnu? who Tamil cinema knows very well, their romance doesn?t hinder the story much. But the tangible collective sigh that rose from the audience when the narrative cuts back to romance, gives me hope that this trend would change. Maybe soon, directors would not have to include a love story just for the sake of it.',real
'American novelist, essayist and critic Francine Prose, who is in Mumbai to attend the Tata Literature Live!, has never shied away from taking the nuanced, if difficult, position in a debate. In 2015, she was one of the writers who objected to PEN giving the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical magazine which she said ?drew crude caricatures? and ?mocked at religion?. More recently, she had drawn flak for an article that takes on social media activism against ?cultural appropriation?. In a phone interview to Indian Express , Prose spoke about the divisions that are driving Americans apart and what, in these circumstances, gives her hopeOne of your most well-known books, ?Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932? fictionalises a certain period in history. How do you maintain the balance between fact and fiction in a novel?Of course, I had to do a lot of research. You have to do that even if you?re writing a novel, because you don?t want to have the sort of mistake that will throw the reader out of the novel. For example, having the Berlin Olympics happen in a different year than they did. So I wanted to get those things right. It is also one of the advantages of writing a novel that you are not constrained by certain things about history. I have no idea what the dinner before the Olympics opened was like, but I was able to imagine it. So much of the novel is also about whether different people?s version of history is accurate or not. So that was part of what I was thinking as well.In the novel, we hear from many people, including Picasso as well as Gabor Tsenyi, the fictional photographer modelled on Brassai, and Baroness Lily de Rossignol, based on Peggy Guggenheim. Why do we never hear directly from the central character, Lou Villars?Some of it was just practical. I couldn?t do it. I kept trying and it didn?t work. It just didn?t sound right. But also, one of the things I realised I was writing about was the mystery of evil. I wanted it to stay a mystery. It seemed to me to write from her point of view would necessarily diminish that mystery.Your bestselling book till date is ?Reading like a Writer?. What prompted you to write it?Two things. One was that it became clear to me that students wanted to be writers without reading. I was once talking to graduate students in writing and they had never read Dostoevsky, and I said, how is this possible. But also, many of the chapters in that book were based on lectures I had given at various conferences so I just decided to put them together.You?ve written over 30 books so far, besides teaching and writing articles and essays. Are you a fast writer?I am now. Not fiction, really. I?m not a fast writer of fiction, but essays, especially since the election. I have been doing a lot of political journalism for the Guardian and I have been writing a lot for the New York Review of Books, and I have learnt to do those pieces fairly quickly, by necessity sometimes, because when the Guardian asks me to write, it?s about something that has just happened and they and I don?t have the luxury of my waiting two weeks to think through an idea. It?s the way things are happening now, so quickly, so I have to really respond really rapidly.In one of your articles, you called for a ?general strike? against the new US government. That?s not happened, of course, but do you think there?s still resistance?I think that?s a very complicated question. The way things are, the way they have been normalised, people can?t be demonstrating on the streets every day of their lives. It?s just not possible. There?s tremendous resistance, but I think there?s also a feeling of hoping that the various investigations will turn up something and our government will finally do the right thing because of the idea that private citizens with placards on the streets will be listened to ? I don?t think anyone really believes that anymore.What gives you hope for these times?I teach a literature class at Bard, and my students are so alert and so alive and so looking for some way to solve this incredible problem, the situation we are in. Honestly, the only times I feel hopeful are when I come out of class on Friday afternoons and I think that OK, it is possible that this generation will be able to deal with this.A recent study by the Pew Centre says that this is the most divided that the USA has been since the Civil War. Do you agree?It?s terrible. It?s really a terrible moment in our history. The fact that we have a government trying to increase this division rather than close it, is not helping, believe me. But there?s a terrible division. For example, when you publish an article or put something online, the comments page is just people raging at each other. No one seems to be looking for common ground or in a way. Every piece that I write for one of these papers, I manage to put in just some line saying that it?s not helpful to have this kind of anger across party lines, across cultural and social divides and no one seems to read that. They read the headline and then they start typing. There?s a lot of displacement going on. That is, people who have no idea anymore what to do about our government, and they take out their anger on soft targets.You?re not afraid to take the difficult position, like when you protested against the award for Charlie Hebdo. How do you feel now about the controversy?',real
'A meeting of the city corporation council on Saturday ended in scuffle between members of the ruling CPM and Opposition BJP. Mayor and CPM leader V K Prasanth was injured in the melee and hospitalised. The meeting was held to mark the present council?s two years in office.Trouble started with the BJP moving a resolution in the council questioning a ban on setting up high-mast lights at junctions with local area development funds of legislators. The BJP wanted the circular, banning the use of MP/MLA funds, to be withdrawn.The mayor pointed out that it was illegal on the part of the opposition to demand withdrawal of the circular, which temporarily banned construction of high-mast lights. When the mayor left his chamber after completing other proceedings in the council hall, BJP councillors reportedly manhandled him. He was pulled down allegedly by BJP councillors when he was going up the stairs.Prasanth was admitted to an intensive care unit of a medical college hospital. Two ruling front councillors, an aide of the mayor and three BJP councillors were also injured.

'It?s an effort that attempts to bring closer to the residents of Chandigarh, the work, vision and genius of Swiss architect Pierre Jeanneret, who collaborated with his cousin, Le Corbusier, for about 20 years in realising the urban fabric of India?s first planned modern city. The first chief architect of the city, Jeanneret made Chandigarh his home and work place, carefully monitoring and supervising the city?s construction on a day-to-day basis.On Jeanneret?s 50th death anniversary (March 22, 1896 ? December 4, 1967), the Chandigarh College of Architecture is organising a symposium ?Pierre Jeanneret, The Foot Architect of Chandigarh? (December 3 and 4) to commemorate his legacy, designing a series of events that will be open to the public.The philosophy of the symposium being to get the citizens of Chandigarh closer to the history of the city, the work of Jeanneret and also involve them in the preservation of the city and its unique architecture.?We want the people of Chandigarh to participate and be involved in the event, and that is why we have worked on ideas that will appeal to a larger audience, and at the same time, introduce them to the legacy and work of Jeanneret,? said Sangeeta Bagga Mehta, principal of the college.The symposium will begin with guided tours by students and faculty of CCA to the Capitol Complex, Pierre Jeanneret Museum; Old architect?s office (Le Corbusier Centre) and key buildings of the Panjab University. ?As part of the tour, people can go up to the terraces of some of the buildings of PU and also the housing here, and photograph the spectacular views. The entire college, both students and faculty are involved in every aspect of the effort,? adds Mehta.Jeanneret was responsible for designing iconic buildings such as the Gandhi Bhawan and the University Library at Panjab University, MLA Hostels in Sector 3 and 4, Polytechnic for Men (now CCET) in Sector 26, the State Library, Town Hall and the General Post Office Building in Sector 17, the Architects? Office (now Le Corbusier Centre) in Sector 19, the PGIMER in Sector 12.Jeanneret also designed furniture, both independently and with Charlotte Perriand, experimenting with minimalist design, green architecture and spaces that were energy efficient.The symposium will also include an exhibition of photographs of the buildings of PU designed by Jeanneret, as well as a showcase of drawings, maps, and archival material in collaboration with the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal.The keynote lecture, ?Remembering Pierre Jeanneret: Celebrating the Power of the Ordinary? will be delivered by Professor Kiran Joshi, who has written a book on Jeanneret, with architects Jit Malhotra and SD Sharma, who worked with Jeanneret, being honoured on the occasion.The second day, December 4, will be dedicated to panel sessions by prominent academicians and practising architects .The detailed programme is attached.

'The Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has decided to junk the recommendations of a parliamentary committee report which was the first ever government document to recognise the rights of transgender persons to partnerships and marriage, so that they were no longer criminalised under IPC Section 377, apart from offering other rights.The ministry is set to re-introduce its original version of The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, in the next session of Parliament.?The Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment, comprising 18 Lok Sabha members and headed by BJP MP Ramesh Bais, tabled its report on the floor of the House in July 2017. The report recommended specific provisions in the ministry?s version of the transgender Bill, to safeguard their rights, protect them against discrimination, and provide quotas in government colleges and jobs.On whether the recommendations of the panel would be included in a revised version of the Bill, Social Justice Minister Thawaar Chand Gehlot told The Sunday Express, ?We will be forwarding our original Bill as it is. Our ministry feels that the Bill made by us is good and there is no need to change it.? Gehlot added that the ministry will try to place the Bill in the Winter Session of Parliament. ?It depends on the Parliamentary Affairs Ministry whether to include it in their business. We will try that it comes before this session,? he said.The parliamentary panel report, hailed as progressive by many within the community, had faulted the government?s Bill for its failure to address several crucial issues. Noting that ?Transgender persons remain at risk of criminalisation under Section 377?, it asked that the Bill must recognise their civil rights such as marriage, divorce, adoption, whether under personal or secular laws.While the August 2017 Supreme Court nine-judge bench Right to Privacy judgment had made strong observations on the need to decriminalise IPC Section 377 (which currently penalises sexual intercourse ?against the order of nature?), the matter is still pending consideration before the apex court in a separate case.The panel?s recommendation was meant to accord legal recognition and protection from Section 377 to, if not all sexual minorities, at least transgender persons whose welfare comes under the Social Justice Ministry. In April 2016, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva?s Bill on transgender rights had become the first private member?s Bill to be passed by the House in 45 years. It was after the passage of his Bill in the Rajya Sabha that the government said that it would table its own version of the Bill, which it did in the Lower House in August 2016. Unlike the private member Bill, the ministry?s Bill had several omissions, including reservations in jobs and education (a Supreme Court directive).The parliamentary panel, set up to study the Bill, asked for reservations, strong provisions against discrimination, penalties on government officials who subject transgender persons to any kind of violence, skill training to wean them off begging, and separate public toilets for them.Going beyond rights and welfare, the panel report also addressed the issue of sexual identity. It asked for provisions that provide ?penal action against abortions of intersex foetuses and forced surgical assignment of sex of intersex infants.? Most importantly, it redefined several terms in the Bill. To recognise alternative family structures such as adoptions of transgender children by the the Hijra or Aravani communities, it defined family in the Bill as ?a group of people related by blood, marriage or by adoption of a transgender person?.The ministry?s proposed definition of transgender persons as ?neither wholly male or female, a combination of female or male, neither female nor male? was criticised by the panel as ?primitive and based on the underlying assumption of biological determinism? and hence, it said, it should simply be ?one whose gender does not match with the gender assigned to that person at birth?.',real
'As per an ?idf.org? report, diabetes took the life of at least a million people in 2013. The number of diabetes cases in India skyrocketed to more than 65 million in 2013 and as a result, the overall cost of treatment increased as well. International Diabetes Federation, in a 2012 report, stated that the number of cases in India is going to cross the 100 million mark by 2030. From these reports, one thing is certain ? diabetes is one of the biggest killers in India.Because it is a chronic disease, controlling diabetes requires a lot of money. In addition to hospitalization and treatment, the patient has to undergo regular tests and check-ups. This can easily put a dampener on the household budget of the patient. Studies in India have found out that if there is one patient in a low-income Indian household, around 20\% of the family income may be devoted to their care.Early diagnosis can still benefit a patient in some ways, but if someone has a long-standing undiagnosed diabetes, the cost of treatment drastically increases. According to an ?idf? report, ?global health spending to treat diabetes and manage complications totaled at least $ 548 billion (US) in 2013.? People in countries like India have to pay more for the treatment owing to lack of medical services and limited access to health insurance. The same report suggests in 2013, the economic burden of diabetes could?ve been around Rs. 30,000 Crore! The numbers are staggeringly high, and to some extent, the patients themselves are responsible.A lot of people refrain from buying insurance early on in their life and feel the brunt of it at an older age. That is why it is crucial to have a separate emergency fund. At the very least, insurance gives you mental peace. Choosing the right insurance provider is of equal importance. An insurance plan that is solely centered around chronic diseases would benefit a diabetic more than a generic insurance plan.Activ Health by Aditya Birla Health Insurance is one plan that comes equipped with an inbuilt Chronic Management Program tailor-made keeping chronic diseases in focus. It is unique because the plan covers you from day one i.e. as soon as you have bought the plan, or are diagnosed with diabetes during the policy term. Specifically designed for people with chronic conditions like Diabetes, Asthma, High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol, the program aims to help them on their journey to good health.',real

'Uber is working on improving the accuracy of the blue or pin location dot in India where connectivity remains an issue. This is a bigger challenge in the Indian market due to the lack of systematic urban planning as a result of which people keep referring to landmarks instead of exact addresses.So the ride hailing company is looking at features that are inspired by the peculiar problems of India. For instance, it is introducing cached destinations features, which works offline to address Internet problems, Manik Gupta, Senior Director of Product, Marketplace and Maps told Indianexpress.com. ?We are giving you a set of pickup points when you enter a destination. That is very helpful because it makes it easier for people to get to the ride, and limitations of blue dot accuracy doesn?t come in the way,? said Gupta.Notably, cached destinations (which will be rolled out in the next few weeks) work offline only while putting in destination in app, but users will need an active connection to book a ride. He added that the feature is essentially for intermittent networks or scenarios where Internet might not always be consistent.?If you look at the addressing system in India, it is very randomised, and because of that users have figured out that relying on the exact address is not a very important thing for them to go anywhere. So they search for a landmark, and this is how people navigate. That?s why we have introduced cached search so that we can show top points of interest that people are familiar with it,? he pointed out. Of course, cached destinations will be personalised to a user as well as city.Coming to the issue of Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), which might not always be accurate, Manik says that this is a challenge that everybody in the industry faces. It isn?t just one thing that Uber takes into account while displaying the ETA on the app. Fundamentally, it depends on the route or distance, and traffic conditions based on that route.Uber?s big focus on India: Exploring offline bookings, Autohawk pilot project and more?So many things can go wrong here because the traffic can change and sometimes driver can miss a turn or the map data was not accurate for the route that we suggested. We are improving our models, trying to understand traffic better, and how we can generate better routes. It?s a lot of continuous improvements,? he added.Gupta admits that a lot of problems, including Internet connectivity, are not India-specific. So a majority of innovations that the company explores is from a global perspective. ?Even in the US we have issues from time to time with service providers. A lot of work that we?re doing is global like improving the overall accuracy of the blue dot and show customised pick-up points,? he said.Reiterating his stance, Uber?s vice-president and head of product Daniel Graf said that some of the things that we see in India are similar in Brazil. However, the scenario is a little different in developed cities like London. ?In India, occasionally I?m on a 3G network or even slower than that. In those conditions, to have the app working properly, you need to take special steps. Those are the conditions that we do not see in other places, like for example London,? Graf explained.Now Uber riders in India can book rides via company?s webpage m.uber.com, without the need for Uber app. This is a feature unique to India, he added. Uber?s head of engineering Apurva Dalal told Indianexpress.com that most rides in India happen via cash, and that it is still one of the most dominant methods. ?Especially first time riders don?t want to set up their wallets, quickly pay by cash and see how it works. First time riders use cash a lot more,? he said.',real
'The UK has placed a temporary ban on a rare annotated copy of a book by William Shakespeare?s venerable rival Ben Jonson in an aim to keep it in the country.The rare copy of ?The Silent Woman?, a comedy first performed in 1609, faces the risk of going overseas unless a buyer can be found in the next few months to match the recommended price of $63,000, reports Xinhua news agency.Jonson (1572-1637) is hailed as the most important writer of the English Renaissance after Shakespeare, having lived and worked in an age of great social change that produced some of the finest works of English literature.A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said the extraordinarily rare volume is the only known example of a document showing how a play by Jonson was prepared for performance.?This volume occupies a unique place among surviving materials because of the nature and range of its annotations, including stage directions, details of props, and textual corrections, which collectively do not fall into any category previously known to scholars of seventeenth-century theatre,? she said on Monday.?The volume is of outstanding interest to the study of English theatrical history.?',real

Hyten said.?And we?ll come up with options with a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that?s the way it works.?In the event that Trump decided to launch a nuclear attack, Hyten would provide him with strike options that are legal.The command would control nuclear forces in a war.The comments come as the threat of nuclear attack from North Korea remains a serious concern and Trump?s critics question his temperament.Trump?s taunting tweets aimed at Pyongyang have sparked concerns primarily among congressional Democrats that he may be inciting a war with North Korea.During testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, retired General Robert Kehler who served as the head of Strategic Command from January 2011 to November 2013, also said the US armed forces are obligated to follow legal orders, not illegal ones.Hyten said he?s talked it over with Trump.?I think some people think we?re stupid. We?re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility how do you not think about it?,? he said.He said he would not obey an illegal order.?You could go to jail for the rest of your life,? he said.',real
'Over the last one week, teams from Pune Newsline visited two colleges in the city ? Fergusson College and the Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce (BMCC) ? to find out the students? views on wearing helmets. At both the colleges, a majority of the students admitted to not wearing helmets.However, most students at the College of Engineering in Pune (COEP) said they were in favour of wearing one. Many of them were seen riding around the campus wearing a helmet; however, pillion riders were still without them.Sayali Salunke, a final year student of Computer Science, said she doesn?t go anywhere without her helmet. ?My father won?t let me ride if I don?t wear a helmet? I also think it is safe,? she said.Sneha B, a student of Engineering in Production and Industrial Management, had different views. ?I used to wear a helmet. But now I don?t. It is uncomfortable and heavy. It also causes trouble when there is too much air and dust. The dust particles on the visor block the vision,? she said.Tanmay Khare, a final year student of Mechanical Engineering from COEP, said, ?I wear my helmet everyday because I feel safer. An additional benefit of the helmet is that it is less stressful to the eyes. The visor keeps the smoke and pollution away from the face.?His classmate, Atharv Naik, also wears one on a daily basis but avoids it on shorter rides. He added that most residents don?t abide by traffic rules, as cops hardly catch the defaulters.Salil Tawde said, ?The traffic in Pune is horrible and nobody follows the rules. Traffic police? hardly catch violators. So, it is important that people understand the importance of wearing helmets and abide by the rules.?Mrudul Dighe, a student of Electronics and Telecommunication, said it was important to wear a helmet but it could be avoided on shorter rides. An incident, he said, has made him more cautious. ?A friend of mine had an accident, and sustained severe injuries as he was not wearing a helmet,? Dhige said.Ramesh Kadam, a student of M Tech in Computer Engineering, has been consistent in following all the traffic rules. He said he was particular about always wearing a helmet, as ?nobody in Pune drives safely?.Rohit Kulkarni, who works in the media department of the COEP, said helmets should be worn by everyone but people should choose wisely. ?A helmet should fit you and be comfortable. However, it is difficult for girls to find a helmet specifically designed for them. Most of the shops provide unisex models, which are not always feasible.?Dashmeet Ajmani, a third-year student of Computer Engineering, said she had had some bad experiences with the first helmet she had bought. But she was careful while purchasing the second one. ?My first helmet was very uncomfortable. It didn?t fit. I couldn?t even sneeze, or wear my spectacles. My current helmet is an open design. I think it?s a unisex model?? she said.Most of the students said they wear a helmet as their parents have forbidden them to ride without one. Yuvraj Chavan, who is pursuing M Tech from COEP, said, ?I don?t go out without a helmet, as my family insists that I wear it.?Bhagvayshri Bhirud, meanwhile, said she rides without a helmet but thinks it is important to wear one. A third-year M Tech student, Bhirud lives near the college campus. ?I don?t travel much. I hardly cover 3-4 kms on my scooty. So, I don?t need a helmet. Another issue is that helmets are too heavy to be carried around. Most of the two-wheelers have space to store helmets, but my scooty has no such slot. However, I think traffic in Pune is not safe, so everyone should mandatorily wear helmets unless they have a genuine issue,? she addedSatyajeet, a first-year student of Metallurgy Department, said, ?I drive both a two-wheeler and a four-wheeler. I notice how rash some two-wheeler riders are. So, I wear a helmet because it is the only way one can ensure safety.?',real

'THREE MONTHS after the Varnika Kundu stalking case shook Chandigarh, the transport department has proposed that women drivers may install cameras on their dashboards, which will help capture the entire front view from their vehicle.Director, State Transport Authority, Amit Talwar maintains dash cameras ?are really helpful because they provide evidence? for the driver in various circumstances.He said that an advisory would be issued for general awareness in this regard. An official of the engineering wing present in the meeting of the Road Safety Council where the discussion took place, said, ?In fact, the members did find such dash cams useful but they were of the view that these cannot be made mandatory for everybody but an advisory can be issued and people, especially women, should be encouraged to install such cameras. After the IAS officer?s daughter case, these cameras can be helpful in providing evidence to the police in such cases. It will capture the front view of the complete journey.?The matter came up for discussion when the STA proposed that dash cameras be installed in CTU buses, and participants agreed that these devices would not only help in providing evidence in case the CTU bus is involved in an accident, but would also record the reckless driving and any other unpleasant situation. ?The videotapes can be provided to the court,? said another officer.Lt Col Jagwant Singh Bath (retired), a member of the Road Safety Council who was present in the meeting said, ?In fact, such cameras are very much being used in Russia because the traffic conditions there are as worse as ours. The primary advantage of these cameras goes to the drivers as they can prove themselves with the help of recording. If [Varnika Kundu]?s car had this dash camera, the videotapes would have immediately shown what the men did.?Though most of Varnika?s ordeal consisted of the men chasing her car in their vehicle, Bath asserted that the mere presence of a camera would also act as a deterrent to such criminal conduct.?He added that members decided not to make it mandatory but create more and more awareness by traffic police to install these.',real

'WITH POLLING DAY done and dusted after an extensive campaign, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh is in a buoyant mood. ?I may look relaxed but I am neither idle nor out of the job. It?s time to gain some energy as the counting of the votes will happen on December 18. I will be back in action soon with renewed energy. I am forming the next government, which is going to be a surprise to all of BJP?s top strategists. The BJP doesn?t even know that some seats they are certain of winning are coming to the Congress tally?, the 83-year old Congress veteran told a group of supporters from Shimla (Rural), from where his son Vikramaditya Singh contested this time.When an enthusiastic young supporter suggested, ?Raja Sahib, our next MLA (candidate Vikramaditya Singh) should get a Cabinet berth, he retorted with a smile. ?Ah, no such recommendation please. First-timers can?t be made ministers. But I am certainly looking for a bride for him and will ensure that he gets married first before giving him responsibility in the government, such as the job of a Parliamentary Secretary,? he said.The CM added, ?What?s encouraging is that I will be beating the anti-incumbency factor. People talk about BJP and Congress swapping power every five years. But this time, our vote share is going to improve and number of seats will also increase. We will have comfortable numbers, maybe 40 or more. My doors are also open for Independents. A few are already in touch with me.?One of the two factors that he views as favourable to him is public endorsement to development. ?So much work has been done on roads, bridges, water supply schemes, health infrastructure, many new institutions and 58 new colleges opened?? he recalled.Secondly, he says, the BJP?s ?negative campaign demeaning Himachal Pradesh? and claiming that no development took place did not work for them. Their ?personalised campaign targeted him on alleged corruption, he pointed out. He claimed that the BJP pumping crores of money in the campaign, and sending an array of Cabinet ministers , whose only agenda was to ?spew venom? against him had generated a sympathy factor in his favour.Virbhadra said his campaign was positive and they (BJP star campaigners) failed to distract from his focus to push his development agenda.?What hurt Himachalis most was Prime Minister Narendra Modi using intemperate language against me. If I have been elected to the CM?s post six times, don?t people know my clean image, my commitment to the state and hard work? They are also aware that the cases against me are fabricated. These are aimed at finishing me off politically because the BJP sees me as the biggest hurdle in getting power,? said Chief Minister.He said former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a ?real statesman? and never resorted to unfounded criticism of any chief minister of governments of other parties.?Modiji needs to take some lessons on how Vajpayee used to conduct himself and campaign.?',real

'Time and again Amitabh Bachchan has proved that age has nothing to do with style. His fashionable blazers have always been the talk of the town and while his approach to fashion is definitely different, we can?t say that he has always managed to deliver.Recently, senior Bachchan was spotted with his son in a colourful sweatshirt at his granddaughter Aaradhya?s birthday celebration at JW Marriott, Mumbai. To give it a funky twist Amitabh Bachchan wore a scarf tucked inside his Marcelo Burlon sweatshirt along with his usual luxe loafers.Even son Abhishek Bachchan decided to follow his father?s footsteps but looks like he was not keen to experiment. Junior Bachchan paired it with his casuals from Dolce & Gabbana and styled it with white shoes.This is not the first time when they wore something similar.
